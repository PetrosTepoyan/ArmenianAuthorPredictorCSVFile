0,David of Sassoon (Samuelian),great lion mher with his noble pride for forty long years ruled sassoon far and wide his rule was so awesome that in his day across sassoon s peaks even birds feared to stray far from the highlands where sassoon was found his dreaded fame spread with a thunderous sound and praise for the high deeds of lion mher on thousands of lips in one voice filled the air ii he ruled in sassoon with lionly might the prince of the highlands unchallenged in right for forty long years he ruled without foe and in forty long years he knew not one woe but now as old age upon him descended this valiant man s heart a pang apprehended which prompted the aging grand hero to ponder my life s autumn days will soon take me yonder the captive of earth and its black sandy cloak the fame of mher shall vanish like smoke and my name and my might and my glory shall pass in my orphaned and leaderless realm shall amass thousands of bandits and fiends on the make no heir have i left no successor to take my sword in his hand for sassoon s protection so thought the great prince in pensive dejection iii then one day as he thought his grey eyebrows knit tight an angel from heaven in fiery light came to the prince feet fixed on a cloud bringing a message proclaiming aloud greetings your highness o sassoon s great lord your voice to god s throne in high heaven has soared and soon shall he grant you the heir that you seek heed me well though prince mher great king of this peak on the day that the lord gives effect to your prayer    neither you nor your wife shall he suffer to spare may god s will be done said mher without sigh death is our lot; all mortals must die but when in this world we ve a child in our stead through our child we live although we be dead and then in a flash the angel took flight and nine months and nine hours from that joyous sight to lion mher a child was born and he called his cub david on that happy morn he summoned his brother ohan of great voice and his realm he bequeathed no time to rejoice to his brother ohan and his newly born son knowing his days and his wife s were now done iv in those times reigned a king over egypt victorious called melik of musr mighty and glorious as soon as he learned of great mher s demise he set for sassoon to conquer a prize ohan of great voice trembled in fear bowing his head as the warlord came near down on his knees begging he said you be our master quaked he with dread so long as we re under the force of your sway we ll be your true servants your tribute we ll pay but on one condition our land must remain untouched and intact for as long as you reign no said melik your whole nation must go under my sword their submission to show and prove that whatever my policy be no native of sassoon shall rise against me ohan called his people from near and from far they passed one by one ‘neath melik s scimitar all except david who try though they did refused to do honor as melik had bid the crowd dragged him forward by force to his foe    raging he tossed them away high and low he grazed his small finger against a large rock emitting a lightening bolt to the crowd’s shock this rogue he is trouble i must kill him off said the king to the elders who started to scoff king they protested you’re mighty and strong how could this young lad do you any wrong though he were fire from head down to foot after everyone under your sword you have put you think you know best said melik with alarm but be warned if upon me should ever come harm upon this boy s head shall the penalty rest as this day s defiant events do attest v at the time of this clash david the great was but a small boy of seven or eight a boy though i say he was strong as could be all were the same to him man beast or flea it s an old saying but truth it does hold eat up your porridge grow up strong and bold but pity this child no keeper on earth although mher s son they knew not his worth ohan of great voice had a mean wicked wife her tongue she first held then started the strife i m only one person with thousands of cares enough mouths to feed without rearing theirs what did i do that you took in this knave i m telling you straight i m nobody s slave i ll bury this boy if you don t send him packing so set something up work s what he s lacking and then she began to moan and complain that she was so poor that all was in vain her burdens were boundless at least in her eyes i ve no keeper no helper no pity no prize    ohan went and thought now what shall i do he found iron boots for the boy as a shoe and a large iron rod to sling on his back a shepherd he made him sassoon s sheep to track vi our hero the shepherd tended his sheep he wandered the hills of sassoon high and steep hey my dear highlands o sassoon s highlands he shouted in joy his voice echoed so rumbling it bounced from the peaks high and low and the birds and the beasts fled their lairs and their nests scampering on rocks with no where for rest david gave chase o’er the hills and the vales the fox and the deer the hares and the quails gathering them up he climbed top the rocks he mixed them all up with the sheep in his flocks down to the town of sassoon they stampeded with noise dust and uproar they brayed and they bleated the city folk cried their eyes not believing the livestock charged forth the town s life upheaving oh help someone save us the children cried out the grownups in panic their work threw about wherever they hid at home church or store they locked up the windows and bolted the door when david arrived and stood in the square he looked all about but no one was there yo there he shouted it s too soon to sleep i ve come with your goats and brought you your sheep goatherds and shepherds get up from the sack for each one i took ten i ve brought back hurry come get them and take them away to your barns for safekeeping or else they will stray     but no one came out the doors didn t budge back to the hills too tired to trudge he pulled up a rock and rested his head and soon fell asleep the square for a bed when the sun rose the town s folk emerged at old ohan s house they quickly converged hey there old ohan of the great voice it s you or the kid you ve left us no choice how could you put our whole flock in his hands the town s filled with beasts he s ruined our lands he can t tell a fox from a lamb what a mess so find him another job quick and god bless vii ohan rushed away his nephew to see uncle tread softly these goats like to flee said david who d spent all night keeping them there but as he approached the ears of a hare perked up and he dashed away into the wood and david gave chase as fast as he could over the hills and over the dales he chased the grey hare through the mountainous trails he caught him and brought him right back to the camp mixed him in with the goats and then smiled like a champ the black ones god bless them i like them just fine but uncle the grey ones they won t stay in line all day yesterday they hopped all around in order to catch them i covered some ground ohan took a look at david s new boots iron shoes were not equal to david s pursuits the rod like the boots was worn away so much had he run in only one day david my lad he said with affection those grey ones abused your valiant protection i ll leave you no more to their wily devices tomorrow for you cow pasture suffices     ohan went his way and on the next morn he brought new steel boots for the ones that were worn and a new iron staff for david s strong hand and made david guard of sassoon s pasture land viii up to the pasture he went with his herds to sassoon s still highlands fair beyond words o my dear highlands sassoon s sweet peaks my heart in your bosom finds just what it seeks he shouted aloud in his voice pure and strong the canyons and mountain tops rang with his song the birds and the beasts fled their nests and their lairs they scampered away to avoid david s snares as david pursued them through hill and through dale he chased them around every mountainous trail the wolf and the leopard tiger lion and bear he caught and mixed in with the herd in his care and drove them back down to the town of sassoon with rumbling and grunting in midafternoon the town s folk again were aroused from their chores by the charging of beasts they were drawn out of doors oh no get away the young and old cried their hearts in a panic their work flung aside and they fled to their houses their churches and stores they locked up the windows and bolted the doors when david arrived and stood in the square he looked all about but no one was there how early you city folk turn in for sleep come see what s become of the herd in my keep    for each cow and ox i ve brought ten in its stead and for each ten you gave me twenty i ve bred hurry up come on out and take them away or else your new cattle will run and go stray but no one came out the doors didn t budge back to the hills too tired to trudge he pulled up a rock and rested his head and soon fell asleep the square for a bed when the sun rose the town s folk emerged at old ohan s house they quickly converged ohan we ve had it now look what he s done our cattle and oxen he s let loose to run he can t tell a lion from an ox or a cow whatever it takes get rid of him now this boy hear us well spells nothing but trouble he ll make our fair town a bear s den and rubble ix try as he might he didn t fit in the boy was a rebel ohan couldn t win for david he fixed up a bow and some arrows you re off to the hills to hunt quail and sparrows david took up the bow and was ready to roam leaving sassoon his folks and his home he marched through the barley fields up the steep trail and started to hunt the sparrows and quail at dusk he caught sight of a very poor shack he sprawled on the floor the hearth to his back in the shack an old woman who d known of his dad lived alone without children and took in the lad one day he returned from his regular hunt the old woman yelled to him plainly and blunt i ll be damned you re his boy the king s only heir you re david the son of lion mher i am old and my arms and my legs they are shot my worldly possessions are myself and this plot so why must you trample it on your sorties and wreck my year s crops do tell if you please    and what kind of hunter seeks game in these parts seghanasar is the place to practice those arts dzdzmaga was the gate to the king s hunting ground there the deer and the goats and the wild sheep abound go there if you’re looking to hunt real game instead of round here where the creatures are tame why do you scold me in words sharp and base i am young i d no knowledge of this special place where please do tell is the king s hunting ground well go ask your uncle he knows where it s found x the next day at dawn he was at ohan s door with his bow in his hand he gave ohan what for you never said that my dad had a grove in the mountains where game used to roam by the drove where the rams ran about with the wild goat and deer get up uncle ohan let s go is it near oh david cried ohan who told you these things may they be struck dumb oh how this stings that mountain my lad is not in our hands the game that roamed there have been snatched from our lands it s not like it was in your dad s blessed day and what days those were where have they gone how many times did we eat venison when your father died god forsook us the melik of musr then overtook us with his troops he attacked but we were outmanned he stole all the game and plundered our land where deer and goats roamed now there are none so it was written so it was done now it s all past go back to your work if the melik gets wind of this he ll go beserk david scoffed the mean melik can do me no harm why should my inquiries cause him alarm let the melik of musr stay in his home    what business does he have in our parts to roam get up uncle ohan remember your bow to the mountainous hunting ground we ve got to go so they ventured to lion mher s hunting ground but when they got there they heard not a sound the trees were cut down the fences destroyed the lookouts laid low the land was a void xi when it grew dark they decided to stay ohan of great voice had had a long day his head on his quiver he rested then snored david however was restless and bored his mind was submerged in a deep sea of thought when in the dark a shimmering light caught his eye and he started and jumped to his feet and raced toward the light with his legs fast and fleet bounding he ran to the top of the peak then he glimpsed a white stone in these parts dark and bleak the white marble stone was split in the middle and a flame burnt bright there what a puzzling riddle thought david as he ran as fast as he could to rouse uncle ohan to see if he would wake up and examine this startling sight uncle ohan enough sleep come see the light settled on top of the mountains afar get up uncle ohan it s bright as a star that bobs up and down on a white marble sheet ohan crossed himself twice as he rose to his feet alas my poor lad the light that you ve seen is all that is left of the altar serene of the church of our lady our keeper and hope the convent and church on maruta s slope is called charkhapan where your dad went and prayed each time he set forth and fierce battle made when your father died god forsook us the melik of musr then overtook us    maruta convent he razed to the ground but the altar light pierces the darkness profound xii when david discovered the convent s sad fate he called to old ohan dear uncle please wait i am an orphan no keeper on earth you are my father though not by birth i want to stay here on maruta s peak until i ve rebuilt our convent unique provide me my keeper five hundred skilled men and five thousand workers to build it again just as it was we ve no time to lose send them this week please don t refuse just as he promised ohan brought a corps of five thousand five hundred superior workers to rebuild the convent on high banging and clanging it rose to the sky just as it was in all of its glory the church of our lady a blessed promontory the monks to the convent quickly returned chanting soared up again candles were burned david came down from the convent sublime restored to the splendor of great mher’s time xiii it didn t take long before melik got word david s the prince now or haven t you heard he s rebuilt the convent dear to his dad and for seven years now no tribute you ve had the melik exploded and summoned his lords badin gozbadin claim my just rewards syudin charkhadin set forth straight away leave no stone unturned sassoon has to pay a price for its insolence strike hard and swift remind my dear subjects that tribute s no gift and bring forty maidens radiant and bright    and bring forty short maids of milling height and bring forty tall ones my camels to load they ll work as my servants and tend my abode gozbadin saluted his master and king your tribute in gold and the maids we will bring your wish king of egypt is our glad command we ll vanquish the rebels in armenia s land the melik his wife and his daughter made merry they danced and they sang armenia we ll bury gozbadin the bold on sassoon will make war he ll bring us back servants and gold

gozbadin gozbadin our knight strong and brave you ll whip david handily he s just a knave gozbadin swelled up and nodded with pride thank you my ladies all boasting aside if you will with patience my victory await we ll have more to dance for we ll all celebrate xiv with songs and with laughter his armed men went after sassoon and its people and when they arrived ohan lost his voice and a welcome contrived with salt and bread with tears and dread he bowed down his head and humbly pled whatever you want oh please take your pick our maids or our hard dug gold in coin or brick rosy cheeked maidens so bright and so fair just don’t wreck our lands or rip us asunder    it s god s realm above and melik s down under ohan called together the rosy cheeked girls gozbadin checked them out as if they were pearls and when he d selected he ordered them held in a locked stable then with pride he yelled forty young maidens radiant and bright forty short maidens of milling height forty tall maidens the camels to load they ll all work as servants in melik s abode with glistening gold our king they’ll adorn while their friends in armenia wear black and mourn xv o david where are you armenia s protector dash open the rocks our convent s erector and come to the square sassoon s plight is bleak and david came down from maruta s peak to the old woman s plot where a rusty sword laid trampling the turnips he reached for the blade david you fool get out of my garden scowled the old woman god beg my pardon is my plot the only place that s caught your eye a curse on you david may you suffer and die just look what you ve done you ve levelled my field nothing is left of my winter crop s yield what will i live on can you tell me that you re such a foolish and clumsy spoiled brat were you truly brave you d take up your bow and rule your dad s realm as he did long ago and claim your birthright and live as you ought for too long you ve given sassoon not a thought the melik s sent forces to sack it today why do you scold me he asked in dismay what does the melik dare take from me everything david go home and you ll see the melik is ready to gouge out your eye while you re sitting here all alone idly by    o david wake up he s taking it all he s sent in his warriors to spread  round his gall gozbadin and badin led the attack charkhadin and syudin brought up the back they re plund’ring sassoon and gathering their loot forty gold sacks is their price for tribute and forty young maidens radiant and bright forty short maidens of milling height forty tall maidens the camels to load they ll all work as servants in melik s abode why do you curse me old woman pray tell where i can find these fiends i ll give them hell where are these fiends curse my old ears how could this be his son brings me to tears you re munching on turnips out here in the cold while gozbadin is in your house counting your gold and filling the stable with your town’s fair maids tossing the turnip he reached for his blade he went to his house gozbadin was there weighing the gold with cold greedy care charkhadin and syudin were holding the bag ohan of great voice his tongue didn t wag he stood there in silence his head lowly bowed wringing his hands he was downcast and cowed when david saw this his eyes flushed with rage gozbadin get up get back in your cage this gold is my dad s it s mine to mete out gozbadin called ohan rein in this lout are we getting our tribute this minute or what if we don t mark me well no  if and or but  i ll tell the melik to launch an invasion he ll raze sassoon town there ll be no dissuasion to the ground he will burn it and then plant a park but david unfazed did not fear his bark get out dogs of egypt flee while you can the braves of sassoon fear no living man did you think we were dead or we gave up the ghost    that you can take tribute and rule us and boast then david grew angry and picked up the scales he smashed in gozbadin s head to shrieks and wails the shards of the scales pierced holes in the walls and fly to this day like sharp spiked cannon balls the warriors of musr fled leaving the gold armenia was safe praise david the bold gozbadin and badin quickly turned tail charkhadin and syudin followed their trail xvi dear uncle how could you what can i say we ve great heaps of gold yet you treat me this way you ve made me a servant no keeper on earth abandoned to others is that all i m worth ohan lost patience and cried out you fool the gold was our shield against melik s fierce rule we kept it so that he would turn a kind eye you ll see what will happen when we defy he ll ruin sassoon and plunder our land who can oppose him his onslaught withstand hold it dear uncle he ll answer to me i’m not afraid of him just wait and see then he knocked down the door to the dark dreary stable and rescued the maids before ohan was able to say one more word david told them with glee long life wish for david go home you are free xvii battered and bloodied tattered and muddied the warriors of egypt fled toward their home soil glimpsing their coming caused noise and turmoil the women of egypt first shouted in joy they clapped from their rooftops ahoy there ahoy they re coming they re coming our gold they have brought    gozbadin to sassoon a lesson has taught they ve brought forty maidens our red cows to tend this spring they ll churn butter our clothing they ll mend but as they approached it soon became clear the clapping went silent something s wrong here the women rushed forward and sassily taunted gozbadin you braggard you re not quite as vaunted as boasted and toasted before your excursion you ran cross the mountain tops for your diversion so tell us what’s up that your head’s split in two and where are the maidens and where is your crew the forty tall maids and sacks full of gold and the rout of armenia that you foretold you went off to sassoon like a wolf in the wild and came back a poor dog frightened and mild gozbadin exploded with loud rage and fury shut up all you ingrates i ll be the jury you ve never seen men like the men of sassoon each fiercer and stronger than our whole platoon like mountains they tower; they use logs for arrows their country s rock solid a fort on the narrows even the grass blades are sharper than swords they slaughtered three hundred of our fiercest lords after he d spoken he went to the king running impatiently his news to bring the king chuckled feverishly from his high throne well done brave gozbadin you re back with your own i should reward you for what you have done with egypt s great medal that s bright as the sun so where is the booty and where are the maids the king asked gozbadin how were the raids embarrassed he shrank his eyes to the ground long live the king by my pledge i am bound i barely escaped with my life o great lord armenia has spawned a man like a horde he s crazy fears nothing not orders nor might he smashed in my head with one blow in our fight he said  i won t give you the gold of my dad    and the maids of armenia they just can t be had there s no place for you in the land of sassoon let melik himself come for tribute and boon let him come and we ll fight it out just me and him let him come and i’ll tear him apart limb from limb  the melik of musr flew into a rage call my whole army a war we will wage ten thousand kids new born and male ten thousand boys beardless and pale ten thousand lads growing with time ten thousand grooms enjoying their prime ten thousand men with black beards and hair ten thousand men with heads grey and bare ten thousand buglers our coming to sound ten thousand drummers our cadence to pound call them and arm them with sword bow and shield we ll tame master david and get him to yield i ll pillage and plunder sassoon till it s rubble i ll teach sassoon’s people to cause egypt trouble xviii the melik assembled his numberless forces and went to sassoon with arms men and horses and when he arrived he set up his tent some distance from sassoon where the horde went to the river named batma to quench their great thirst so many were they that when they immersed their mouths in the water the river went dry and the river flow to sassoon slowed by and by until the town s water flow came to a halt distressed ohan wondered what was at fault donning his cloak he searched for the cause on a high look out he took a quick pause he saw tents by the thousands like a blanket of snow just as if winter had fallen below his warm blood ran cold and his tongue became tied running back home god help us he cried woe run away it has come it is here what my dear uncle has caused you such fear    the pain and the fire you ve brought on our heads the melik has come here to tear us to shreds his army outnumbers the stars in the sky woe to our lives woe to our lands gather the maids and gold in our hands let us bow down perhaps he ll forbear perhaps he’ll take pity his sword he might spare hold it there uncle don t blink an eye you re tired and anxious now go home and lie down in your bed while i take a look at what melik s up to so david took his leave and ran off to the old woman s shack hey granny he shouted look i ve come back quick get your skewers and old iron scraps to tie on the donkey with these tattered straps i m taking on melik the way you once said o david she cried god strike me dead how could your father have had such a lad when he went to war a great horse he had a fiery steed and a waistband of gold and in his right hand a cross he would hold he had a mail shirt defense to afford and a thick metal helmet and bright lightening sword and you re off to battle with donkey and skewer okay okay granny your words could be fewer if you would just tell me the place where it’s hid go ask your uncle you’re not just a kid tell him to get it and bring it to you and if he refuses you’ll just have to do whatever it takes to gather his trust but get what is yours as is mete and is just xix david went home to his uncle directly hey uncle he shouted loud and suspectly my father had armor of which i was told    and a fiery steed and a waistband of gold and in his right hand a cross he would bear so as he made battle he gave life no care he had a mail shirt defense to afford and a thick metal helmet and bright lightening sword wherever they are uncle give them to me o david my david say how can this be ohan cried in dread “but since your dad died no one has taken the horse for a ride nor has the sword been out of its case nor the mail shirt nor the gold mace just leave me alone don t torment me take them and use them they re your legacy xx david put on the armor and buckled the band he donned the mail shirt his sword in his hand and raising the victory cross to the sky he mounted the lion s steed and riding high with a snap of his whip he galloped away and ohan of great voice wept for this day ten thousand woes for the steed he has taken ten thousand woes for the gold he s forsaken ten thousand woes for the mail shirt he s wearing ten thousand woes for the sword he s bearing on hearing this david boiled up with rage he turned the steed back and charged to engage his uncle s attention making him smart poor ohan in fear changed his tune and his heart alas my david poor david is lost alas he is lost at such a high cost when david heard this he sighed and calmed down he jumped from the horse and touched ohan s gown he then kissed his hand and ohan of great voice with fatherly care and a nod did rejoice at the sight of this youth and bid him farewell    and sent him away musr melik to quell xxi david s mom had a brother whose name was toros this uncle s fierce exploits unfolded before us when toros got wind of the upcoming battle he pulled up a tree and slaughtered some cattle and then in the distance he was heard yelling you on the plain with your tents i am telling david of sassoon s coming your way how many are you you don t want to stay what are you waiting for haven t you heard he flies on his steed like a great preying bird get away while you ve time before he arrives i m warning you go if you value your lives then from his shoulder he took the tree trunk and swinging it cleared them away with one dunk from the peak david watched and then fiercely roared like a dragon to wake up melik and his horde if you re asleep you d better wake up and if you re awake you d better stand up and if you are standing you d better gear up and if you are geared up you d better mount up and if you are mounted you d better ride on and don t complain later that we were spied on while david attacked like a thief in the night so wake up get ready you re in for a fight making his challenge he spurred on his steed and with shocking bolts down from a cloud the lightening sword glistening followed his lead and struck in the midst of the melik s fierce crowd david wreaked mayhem the first half the day and the rush of their blood like a rising red tide melik s men by the thousands carried away both dead and alive in human landslide    in the midst of the carnage was an old man who d seen much of life and was known as a sage boys said he step aside quick so i can go and see david and quiet his rage the old man set off to plead for his band he went before david o brave one he said may your fist remain strong with a sword in your hand may your sword remain sharp like the thoughts in your head pray hear me out though i m old and i m weak and weigh my words well as our lives you determine what have we done that you wilfully wreak death and destruction and kill us like vermin each one among us is some mother s son each one among us is some household s light who s left his dear wife and his housework undone her wet eyes are fixed on the road in deep fright his children lie shivering in their cold beds his parents are poor bent over and old with crying and mourning veils over their heads the young brides are waiting their grooms to behold melik gathered these men upon pain of death he ordered them here crushing their will they re miserable conscripts who ve breathed their last breath what harm can they do you they bear you no ill so pity us peons mean melik s your foe if you’ve got a bone to pick then in god s name you two should cross swords and fight toe to toe and spare us unfortunate pawns in your game well spoken old man you are wise as your age david said to the grey beard at sassoon s high gate but where s the mean melik that i might engage in oneonone combat and seal his dark fate     you see the great tent that s where he sleeps the one with the smoke coming out of the top it s not real smoke but a foul fume that seeps out of his mouth as he sleeps without stop not a moment to spare david mounted his steed he rode to the tent where the mean melik lay at the door of the tent he arrived with great speed and roared at the guards who cringed in dismay where is he hiding who threatens my lands call him out in the open we ll fight on this field if he isn t dead now he ll die at my hands his match he has met his fate is now sealed the melik they said is in a deep slumber for seven full days his post he s forsaken so far just three days have passed of that number four more still remain before he ll awaken you mean to tell me he naps while his men are swimming in blood as deep as the sea for seven full days he snores in his den while he sends his poor troops to do battle with me sleepshmeep hear me well this is insane get him up send him out we shall meet in the square i ll give him sleep in which he ll remain forever at rest with a tomb for a lair the guards were now shaken and picked up a spear they heated it red in the campfire s heat their king snored so loud that he couldn t hear as they put the hot spear to the soles of his feet how can a man get a decent night s rest as long as these damned fleas are swarming around the giant king muttered then undistressed he turned himself over and slept on the ground so they got a huge plow from a field near the tent    and they heated its blade on the blazing red fire and when it glowed bright and iridescent they put it against the back of their sire how can a man get a decent night s rest as long as these blasted mosquitoes do flit groggy he rubbed his eyes glimpsing a guest it was david who d come to pay a visit he raised his head up and muttered a curse then he blew upon david to sweep him away he huffed and he puffed but he could not coerce david to leave so he shrank in dismay amazement and fear engulfed his cold heart seeing how david withstood his fierce blows his bloody red eyes were fixed like a dart as he frowned upon david and cast a mean pose seeing that david did not flinch at all his beastly strength drained like a wilting bean stalk so he sat up and thought of a way he could stall and he put on a smile and started to talk greetings dear david come in take a chair you must be quite tired let s have a good chat if you re still intent upon settling this affair we ll fight one on one okay how is that under his tent the wily old troll had dug a great pit some forty feet deep he d had a net flung across the wide hole with a rug for a cover his secret to keep whomever he couldn t defeat in combat he lured to his tent to catch in his snare asking them in as his guests just like that they would fall in the pit as they sat unaware so david dismounted from his tall horse and went and sat down upon the guest s rug it gave way and he fell as a matter of course into the pit that melik had dug    melik cackled and smirked at the fate of his guest he ordered a millstone to close off the pit you can rot in the dark my noisome young pest for the rest of your life in my snare you shall sit xxii ohan of great voice slept poorly that night dark dreams filled his head like an unruly crowd o er egypt the sun rose with radiant light but a black cloud hung over sassoon like a shroud stricken with terror he jumped from his bed oh wife light a candle take hold of my hand it s david i know it dark fate on our head a black cloud s descending upon our dear land i ll kill him i tell you scowled his wife who knows where he is the reckless ingrate while you re here at home afraid for your life tormented by dreams about others  fate ohan fell asleep but was wakened again o wife hear me out david s in a tight spot the star over egypt shines brighter than ten while sassoon s star fades away like a dot dammit old man it s after midnight his wife scolded loudly sharply and tart ohan crossed himself not wanting a fight and fell back to sleep though troubled at heart he then dreamt a dream that was yet darker still he saw in the heavenly skyscape on high that egypt s bright star was yet more visible while sassoon s was falling down out of the sky this time he awoke in tortured chagrin a curse on your house why d i listen to you david s in danger he s my last of kin now get me my armor i ve got work to do     xxiii ohan rose from bed and went to the stable he gave the white horse a kind slap on the back tell me old whitey how fast are you able to get me to david to join the attack you ll get there by morning if you ride on me said the horse to ohan belly slumped to the ground and what good is that shall i go there to be in time for the mass at his burial mound he then gave the red horse a slap on the saddle he too dropped its belly down to the ground dear red horse how soon can we join in the battle and fight on the field where david is found the red horse responded in less than an hour you ll be there with david engaged in the battle a curse on your fodder and may it grow sour for nought have i fed you i ve no time to prattle next ohan turned to inspect the black steed he too dropped his belly down to the ground so my black beauty in my time of need can you take me there where david is bound if you wrap your legs tight and get a good grip said the black horse jumping out of his stall before your foot s through the second stirrup you ll be there with david hold on or you ll fall xxiv he led the black horse out for the trip mounting him quickly from the left side before his right foot was through the stirrup atop sassoon s peaks they d gone for a ride and there ohan saw david s horse was forsaken neighing and wandering through the high leas below melik s camp was teeming with men    endlessly streaming like waves on the seas he girded his waist with seven ox skins to hold in the pressure that filled in his cheek he puff like a cloud when the thunder begins and roared from atop sassoon s highest peak hey david ho david wherever you are remember the cross of the great sacrifice and call out the name of our lady afar you’ll see light of day if you heed this advice his voice rumbled loudly from heaven to earth and reached david s ear in the pit dark and bleak hey hey david said with great joy and mirth that s my uncle s loud voice calling from sassoon s peak in the name of our lady on maruta s height and the immortal cross of the great sacrifice i call on you now to ease david s plight so bellowed he forth in a voice that could slice and slice it did for when it hit the millstone was shattered in thousands of parts uncovering the mouth of the deep and dark pit sending fragments to orbit like stonehewn darts david rose from the pit and stood bold and wild melik shuddered in fear and started to squawk david my brother let s be reconciled let s sup together and have a good talk no more shall i sit at the table with you you subhuman cowardly wily old man now go get your arms with no more ado and come to the square as fast as you can have it your way said the melik with spite but on one condition the first blow is mine setting out for the square david shouted all right take your best shot  cause the next one is mine so they stood face to face in the midst of the square    melik mounted his horse with his lance in his hand to diyarbekir town he rode to prepare for his charge against david to make his last stand with clashing and tremors the great charge began with the force of three thousand huge stones his lance hit the earth shook and wobbled as egypt s king ran and the impact raised clouds of thick dust and grey grit an earthquake has struck said the people aghast frightened in far off lands jarred by the blows no said some others it s just some great blast caused by the clash between two mortal foes i ve struck david dead with only one blow melik bragged to his men smug with conceit don t be so sure i m next to go said david unfazed i m still on my feet melik stammered i started too close the first time next time i ll get you i ll build up some speed melik mounted his horse and started to climb over the hills to a far land indeed this time from aleppo he spurred on his horse and stirred up a storm lightening thunder and rain and shaking the world with yet greater force he started his charge with grunting and strain he came and he struck and the sound of the blow left the people close by as deaf as a stone the house of sassoon is finally laid low the melik declared with a snide haughty tone not so fast called out david i m still on my feet now you ve had your turn this time i will go just one more time and you ll meet your defeat i started too close and was charging too slow the third time melik went back to his home and starting from egypt he charged with his lance spurring his horse across the sea foam    he took aim at david across the expanse he struck him once more with all of his strength a huge heavy blow packing hundreds of tons the impact unsettled sassoon s breadth and length raising a dust cloud that darkened the sun three days and three nights dust darkened the skies hanging about like an ominous sign three days and three nights there were wailing and sighs mourning the death of their nation s scion then on the third day in the midst of the dust david emerged like a peak through a cloud majestic and tall standing like a stone bust he shouted to melik who was shaken and cowed melik he said guess whose turn it is next hope you are ready to meet your demise melik s heart trembled as though he were hexed and the haughty king s ego was cut down to size melik fled to a pit in the earth s darker zones which he d dug for himself in terror and fear he sealed it securely with forty millstones and forty thick skins of oxen and deer a lion was david like his father mher growling he rose to set things aright he mounted his horse storming into the air with the great lightening sword in his hand glistening bright melik s wicked old mother came to entreat david for mercy distraught with wild hair my hair sire david trample under your feet i ll bear your first blow if my son you will spare david was poised to strike the next blow melik s sister came forth to settle the strife your sword s second cut i ll undergo straight through my heart just spare him his life the time had arrived to strike the third blow    let no one dare come and stand in my way with god s help we ll at last be rid of this foe but i must strike now with no further delay and strike he did with fury and sound on his fiery steed he soared through the sky a lightening bolt flew from his sword to the ground with such force it was certain that melik would die the lightening bolt struck on the seals to the pit piercing the skins and the stones through and through it struck melik s heart and soon as it hit it severed the fiendish king s body in two melik then called from his dark hiding place i m still alive hit me once more when david heard this he screwed up his face knowing the force that the lightening sword bore melik he said get up move a bit as melik arose and cautiously crept a hole opened up in the place he d been hit and his body collapsed in two as he stepped when melik s troops saw what had become of their miserable leader they scrambled in fear david promised them pardon if they d succumb and urged them sincerely to lend him an ear heed me men of egypt you re tillers of soil you re hungry and tired you re longing for home why have you come to sassoon to despoil our land and our people why do you roam you ve a thousand and one worries and pains you ve a thousand and one troubles to bear we too have our homes our families and strains we too have our young and our old who need care can you explain why you ve traipsed over here are you restless and bored with your calm peaceful lives your land and your kinfolk aren t they dear have you tired of tilling your fields so they thrive    by the route that you came here you now must go back to your homeland of musr in egypt afar but be warned if you ever raise arms and attack us again by some ruinous illfated star no pit that you dig can be dug deep enough no millstones you stack can be piled high enough to spare you the wrath of this son of sassoon or the bright lightening sword with its piercing typhoon then only god will know who will regret it more we who must go to war or you who made us your foe ,8616

pan used for roasting wheat or chickpeas and lit a fire under it she said put this hot sand in your mouth to draw off the pain ile said put it in my mouth yourself he seized her hand and pressed his own hand tightly over hers while he held it down in the roaster oh oh oh david you are burning my hancll i will make you eat this hot sand if you do not tell me were uncle ohan is hiding my father s arms and armor and his horse do you want to kill me let go of my hand and i will tell you he released sara s hand she said david you will find your father s things in our secret storeroom forty feet under the        ground to go down to the storeroom you have to remove a black slab on the floor of the stable and the colt jalali is kept there in a separate section you can enter through a small inside door now that his secret was out uncle ohan consented to give david the keys to the storeroom david lifted the black stone and they went down forty steps to the underground chamber where meherr s arms and armor were hanging on the walls ohan opened a chest inlaid with motherofpearl in which me herr s splendid clothes were neatly folded and he took them out one by one and gave them to david where is my father s sword david said here son in this large clay jar filled with pitch  pull it out if you can david drew the great sword out of the pitch as easily as though he were pulling a hair out of dough he looked at it its jeweled hilt shimmered like a pigeon s neck he kissed his father s sword three times and touched his forehead with it where is my father s mace he asked the mace was used in the stable as a chicken roost forty men could not lift meherr s mace and ohan helped david carry it out of the stable and clean it david put on his fater s clothes and armor the helmet came down to his chin they stuffed seven liters of cotton into it before he could set it on his head the boots were so enor mous he could not wear them without stuffing seven liters of cotton into them the golden belt went three times around his waist the sword was so huge and long that when he slung it from his shoulder half of it scraped against the ground and the other half stuck over his head david asked next where is the victory cross that son i cannot give you that is in god s hands if you are a just man like your father and worthy of it you will se it on your right arm embedded in your flesh like a battlescar you have to pray for the victory cross cry for it fight for it and now let me have my father s irse david said  david fights misra melik    you need your father s horse son if you are going to wear these arms and armor they are so heavy no other horse can all carry them david after your father died i would not let his fiery horse out of the stable for fear misra melik would know about it and want him for himself \ve have been feeding and watering him from the roof  i don t dare go near that horse if you can lead him out of the stable jalali is yours david entered the secret stable through a _ little inside door no one had opened  for twenty years he had his father s ar mor on him and the horse smelled him with tears in his eyes taking him for meherr david caressed his mane stroked his neck and back and the horse kept nuzzling him david led him out of the stable the horse kicked with fiery sparks blazing out from his hooves when he saw it wasn t meherl  the horse spoke by god s order earthborn what do you want to do with me i want to ride you to war david said ride me i will take you up to the clouds and burn you to ashes against the sun;  i can ride under your belly i will smash you to pieces against rocks and trees i will hurl you against the winds throw you into bottomless seas my name is colt jalali if i just breathe on you you will be blown off like so much dust you earthborn fool david said i can ride on your back under your belly on your right side your left side i can hang on to your tail i can even ride in your mouth if i want to some rider jalali said from now on you are my master and i am your horse david kissed him on the head and said you had no master i am your master no one to groom you to hold your halter no one to feed you to give you water to look after you  colt jalali        the horse was covered with a thick layer of dirt and looked pitifully thin and uncared for davi<l led him to barav s and halted before the door of her cottage she was happy to see meherr s horse again that is your father s colt jalali she said david said mamik heat two copperfuls of water i will go get a bar of soap from uncle ohan ancl let us wash ancl clean this horse before i ride him uncle ohan gave him the soap but stayed away from the horse he said he will kick and kill me if i get too close to him with david the horse was gentle and quiet now david said to barav hold his head and let your <laughter pour the water while i wash him they soaped him and scrubbed him seven times then they groomed him carefully in the arab manner ohan finally came over with a measure of barley and a load of hay and david fed his horse uncle ohan give me his silver saddle with the gold stir rups ohan brought him the silver saddle with the gold stirrups and watched him saddle the horse thinking to himself when meherr mounted him j alali reared up on his hind legs if he will do that with david i will let him go fight misra melik all four feet of the horse were off the ground when david seized the silver saddle and put his feet in the gold stirrups he rode up and down a few times and had barav also enjoy a ride with him jalali had found his new master uncle ohan said come my boy let us go to marouta s high mother of god with forty barren heifers and sacrifice them to god kneel and pray before the holy altar while mass is sung and maybe our merciful lord will deem you worthy of being meherr s son early the next morning they drove the forty barren heifers to the monastery and sacrified them to god david bathed in their fresh warm blood he made his confession took the com munion knelt before the altar seven times said tearful prayers  david fights misra melik    and received the holy emblem the cross of marouta s high mother of god and a comb he kissed the cross and kept it on the right side of his breast and he kept the comb on the left side ohan said david with this holy emblem on you you need fear no evil and he said to the superior of the monastery we have only seven days left before misra melik lets his armies loose upon sassoun pray for david and have masses sung for him for seven days and nights i am letting him go fight misra melik when filled with god s grace david may be the sal vation of sassoun and free us from the heathen ohan kissed david on his cheeks david returned to town cured of his lisping david was ready he looked small on the giant horse uncle ohan burst into tears and sang this lament  there goes sassoun s dreaded warhorse i hoped to give to the frank pope alas a thousand times alas there goes sassoun s silver saddle i planned to give to iran s shah alas a thousand times alas there goes sassoun s lightninglike sword helmet of gold and golden belt alas a thousand times alas david s hand gripped the hilt of his sword uncle ohan added in haste there goes sassoun s handsome david our proud young deer and fearless ram the bright firelight of sassoun s house alas a

sassoun sisters mothers neighbors and friends pray for my soul i say farewell to all to all  this sounds like meherr s drum and lute goldenbraids said in her dark sunless chamber when a servant brought her her food the servant said your grandson david has put on his father s arms and armor and is going to fight misra melik he is playing mehcrr s lute meherr s mother came out of her mourning behind seven locked doors deprived of all sunlight she was a very old woman now and as she rose to her feet part of her dress fell to the floor in shreds she opened a window and looked out she saw david coming along at a trot and the horse stopped under her window goldenbraids called the horse by his name and said  brother david our gallant boy we hope and pray that you come back and fill our hearts with pride and joy you are leaving before we could as a bride would welcoine you home help you dismount and hold your horse and pour water over your hands to bake your bread and make your bed david whirled around on his fiery horse and bowed courte ously to the young brides and to all the people gathered around him he played his father s lute and sang a cordial farewell brothers sisters i thank you all it is god s will that i go fight misra melik with all my might  my sisters goodbye goodbye sweet sisters all you are to me for you i will most gladly die  my mothers goodbye goodbye

your blessed father taught him every trick and  f   dayid flgiits misra meld(         showed him all the roads let this fiey horse be your guide wherever you go david dismounted and ran up to her chamber he had never seen her before he kissed her hand and asked for her blessing goldenbraids kissed him on the head blessed him and cursed misra melik she said thank god i have at last attained m y heart s desire now i can die in peace david mounted again uncle ohan came running after him remember what your grandmother said about the milkfoun tain and the iron tree it is a most pleasant place to rest a fountain of immortality in a flowery meadow a wishingwell where your father always stopped on his way to war you will be filled with god s grace at the milkfountain and attain your wish unsaddle your horse eat your bread there before you go any farther and bathe in the spring \vhen you come to the iron tree and test your sword against it you have to cut it at one blow come back if you cannot for that would be an ill omen and remember to say your prayers when you are in trouble don t forget to call upon the holy mother of god in any difficulty and stay on your horse and follow his lead ohan s wife said in a mocking voice david if you think you are brave enough to take on misra melik bring me one of his ears vergo said ohan let him go and learn his lesson he thinks it would be like killing little birds in a millet field ohan said david it is not too late to accept melik s terms we have enough gold and silver in the treasury to pay our tribute and taxes melik has seven kings and seven armies with him well we have a few fighters ourselves i will have some of our men go with you david said no uncle ohan i do not need an army to fight melik and you stay out of tllis war have no fear god is on our s ide i have this sword and the holy emblem with me my going is in my hands my return in god s son i will watch your star  uncle ohan took david s trumpet and played a battle tune of the sassoun champions on it well david your fate  and ours  is now in god s hands may god be with you strike hard at those lawless people uncle taros will guard the main pass with his warriors and my watchmen on the towers of the fort will warn us if melik moves on sassoun bread and wine the living god marouta s high mother of codi david saluted his uncles and all the people who came to see him off and rode out of sassoun at a fast trot once out of the city he slackened the reins he was headed for dzovasar but could see nothing so thick was the mist the horse flew like a falcon through the fog i can trust this horse he said let him take me wherever lie likes i need not worry with such a horse un<ler me j alali covered a distance of seven days in one hour and stopped when he reached a spring on a high rocky peak the fog cleared on the upper ridges of the towering range the horse would not go any farther david said i will break your neck don t be so stubhorn i thougt you could take me across rivers of blood and here you stop before this little stream david dug in his spurs and said i will cut off your head he drew his sword the horse threw him off and spoke again by god s will david this is the sprin$ of immortality your father s milk fountain did you forget what goldenbraids and uncle ohan said about it i can take you up to the sun and burn you to ashes and i can smash you to pieces against these rocks but i will spare you this time for your father s sake you broke my ribs david was sorry he got up and kissed jalali on tle head he unsaddled the lorse took off his bridle and let mm drink his fil� from the sacred spring he cupped his hands and drank from it limself and he splashed the cool sweet vater against the broken ribs of the horse \vbile jalali grazed in the grass (       david took off his clothes and bathed in the spring then he sat down opened his saddlebag and ate his bread he put on his clothes and armor drank some more water it was so won derfully refreshing and stretched out in the meadow for a good nap the horse shaded him from the sun by standing over him david slept between his legs an angel came to him in his sleep and said david david wake up your prayers have been heard yom wish has been granted your sword will be invincible as long as the victory cross on your right arm does not turn black the horse gave him a gentle kick to rouse him from his sleep vhen he awoke david saw the luminous gleam of the victory cross on his right arm his clothes and armor were scattered in the meadow grass around him he had to remove the seven liters of cotton from the golden helmet before he could set it back on his head and even then it was too tight and too tight were his steel boots after he removed the seven liters of cotton he had stuffed into them he forgot to unlace his mailed corselet before going to sleep and i t was torn and busted his golden belt was just long enough now to go around his waist once and the lightning sword barely reached his knees he had grown into a giant during his sleep after drinking from the rrnkfountain and the horse he discovered was completely healed he was over joyed by his amazing transformation he saddled his horse and galloped off toward the battlefield true enough as he was told there was an iron tree by the roadside he drew his sword and cried bread and wine the living god marouta s high mother of god the victory cross on my right arm and smote the iron tree as he swept past it the keen blade did not break or splinter and he thought he cut through the thick steel of this signpost but when he glanced back over his shoulder his leart withered in his breast and he gave a loud groan the iron tree was still standing there by the roadside he slowed down and said  /  /   ;  j    ___             oh damn it all i wish i lad broken my leg broken my arm lost my eyesight and not come here to this signpost to test my strength if i cannot cut it clean through with this great sword it does not fall then how can i split melik s head  he felt disgraced before the horse and thought of turning back but jalali said david do not despair a sudden blast of the south wind broke the iron tree in two where he struck it he sang out in joyous words _____  be strong my legs so good of you to bring me here; well done i say be strong my arms be ever green and grow in might clay after day be clear my eyes shine bright with light as you observe this happy scene i trust in you in this great fight  he wheeled around and rode on gazing left and right he sang to the rocks and springs to the trees and mountains of his native land farewell o springs of dzovasar when i am parched and you too for to slake my thirst how on and on never dry up and make me glad vith thoughts of you in egypt s heat farewell o winds of dzovasar vhen i feel hot and you too far keep on blowing until we meet  sacred springs and cooling winds flovers and trees mountains and rocks  of my homeland; forget me not  david ficiits misra meld{   by nightfall he was on a high mountainpeak overlooking the plain where misra melik s armies were drawn up for battle the blaze of innumerable fires made him pause and gazing down at the awesome spectacle he thought he could no more count these tents of the enemy than he could count the stars in heaven or the sands at the seashore the vast plain swarmed with men and horses david shook his head in dismay and said in a mournful voice if these were spring lambs  merciful god and i a hungry wolf kill them i could not if these were but wool or stacks of dry hay and i flame and flre burn them i could not if this were just wheat nothing but millet and i a reaper reap them i could not if these were ashes and i tle south wind they would

the plain below the struggle of men and horses the blaring of arab trumpets and the rolj of drums the cries of the wounded and dying he called out to his men boys great is our god the sassounians swooped down on vlisra melik s disorganized army and caught between david on one side and uncle toros on the other the egyptians and their ajlies did not know which way to turn to save their lives and killed one another in the dark the massacre continued for three days and nights the battlefie)d ran with blood  there were smart men among the arabs they he]d a war council and said what shall we do we shall be slaughtered alj of us we have to chain him by catching him off guard they threw flaming astragalp into the air and david stopped to watch their crackling flare filling up the sky david this fire is pouring down on you from heaven they shouted in their de spair it is a punishment from goel haven t you killed enough men give up as david was still watching the flames they    brought up their heavy chains carried by a team of forty buffaloes an<l tried lo capture david an<l tie him up david and his horse fought them off before they could <lrnw the chains tightly around them the slaughter continued and david s horse waded through torrents of blood carrying off the bodies of the slain arabs there was another wise man among them an old greybeard father of seven fighters in misra melik s army who dropped his weapons and ran up to david with a bunch of astragali and feathers  on his bare head crying make way i want to talk to david we have to save our men and stop this useless slaucrho ter t}ey macl e way for him and he came and bowed to the ground before david may god preserve your home david the wind made by your horse will knock me over if you don t stop him i

looking for misra melik where is he come i will show you his tent david followed the greybeard and the egyptian troops made way for him with deep salaams and every mark of respect among so many other tents it was not easy to find misra melik s tent the old man stood beside it and said here it is the big green one  with an elephant standing in front and a golden apple glittering on top of the roof the king has been sitting here in his tent eating roast lamb and pilav and drinking wine while we have been fighting and dying for him now i think he is sleeping that is not smoke but his own breath coming out of the tent and the roof of the tent as you can see goes up and down with every breath he takes when misra melik sleeps forty slave girls kneel around him and rub his feet and they fan him and keep away the flies david dismissed the old warrior two arab spearmen stood guard at the door of the king s tent david could see the huge mound of melik s gigantic figure huddled under a quilt inside the tent melik was surrounded by his forty slave girls twenty on each side rubbing his soles and fanning him with green willow branches from head to foot misra melik was forty arrows long david said to the two arabs at the door  wake up your lord if he is asleep and tell him david of sassoun is waiting for him at the door the arabs said  we cannot do that david when the king sleeps he sleeps for seven days and nights and nobody can wake him up during that time i do not care how long he  sleeps and when ie wakes up or does not i cannot wait to please his moods this war will go on if he does not come out of his bed and fight me like a man  david ficiits misra melik    ismil khatoun came to the door and shrank back in fear and horror when she smv david on his fiery horse and both spattered with bloo<l david said good day mother she sai<l with a forced smile david my sweet boy wel come a thousand times welcome i have missed you so much �our sight fills my heart with joy and happiness you were a h �tle boy when you left egypt and now you are so big on that big horse that you frighten me come in and have breakfast with me you must be hungry and tired after so much fighting

very well then i will wake him up myself  will  david lost his patience he dismounted and before he could tether his horse jalali bolted and ran up a mountain the horse did not want him to dismount and was angry with david for not remembering ohan s warning to stay on his back david strode i nto the tent and the slave girls gazed at him with sighs   of adnmation they had never seen such a handsome warrior before and each hoped in her heart david would carry her off and make her his wile       david stabbed melik s toes with his fater s spear melik get up you can sleep later not for seven days but forever melik stirred under his quilt ouch my bed is full of bugs melik was just pretending to be asleep/ ismil khatoun said let him have his sleep the poor boy david said melik don t give me that old wives  tale about bedbugs what bit you was my spear he turned to ismil khatoun and don t give me a headache with your excuses pull him out of heel i cannot wait she heated a plowshare in the £re and held it against his soles ouchi ouchi why can t i have a bed without bedbugs you bitches she wanted to frighten david so that he would say what a strong man melik is she holds a redhot plowshare against his soles and he thinks it s a bedbug melik is not sleeping david said he is wide awake under his quilt and can hear everything we say get up son david is here ismil khatoun said david who is david and melik turned over under his quilt david said just a goatherd and plowman from sassoun melik sat up in bed rubbed his eyes blinked and squinted at david shading one eye with his left hand and his other eye with his right hand as though david were too small to be visible take a good look at death s angel david said if you think you are deathless i have brought you death i have come to claim your soul and send you to deepest hell death s angel you are nothing but dog food you son of a bitch you lad no horse and now you have become a horseman you are giving yourself big airs as a warrior when i fed you the scraps from my table and you used to lap up my food like a dog how did you manage to get here pretended to be somebody else to fool my soldiers get out the man who calls others a son of a bitcl is a dog himself you challenged me and i came i came to fight you fight me misra melik who do you think you are  david fights misra melik    o my little orphan lam] if i eat you for breakfast what would i have for my lunch and if i eat you for lunch what would i have for supper if i eat you for supper what is left for next morning david said if you can eat me for breakfast for lunch or for supper with nothing left for the next day what are you afraid of then melik drew in his breath and let it out as though he could blow david out of his tent the tent rose and staggered in the wind made by his breath but david stood firm before melik and said your troops have laid down their arms and there is no one to fight me now except you this is the clay melik this is the day the divinity will decide between us and give the victory either to me or to you the strength of forty buffaloes drained away from the king he grinned and said the devil take you lisping david if you came to my tent to fight me there is plenty of time for fighting sit down and make yourself at home let us have something to eat i would enjoy having a chat with you why be in such a hurry    ve do not break bread with our enemies david i am still sleepy if you must fight come back tomorrow david said i will be back tomorrow he pitched his little tent near misra melik s and lay down to sleep his feet stuck out of the tent a servant came to him the next morning and invited him to be the king s guest i have fortyyearold pomegranate wine misra melik said in his message the wine tempted him melik met him before the green tent with his sword slung from his shoulder and a large cross hanging on his breast let us reconcile he said but        if you still insist on fighting let us eat and drink together and then fight if i do not eat and drink with him he will think i am afraid david thought entering the tent rugs were spread before the royal tent and david was re ceived formally as the king s guest he was led into the tent by melik and was served fortyyearold wine while the king himself drank new wine suddenly the rug under him gave way and david fell into a well forty cubits deep he was caught in an intricate net of iron rings and chains and the steel trapdoor closed over him melik brought millstones and piled them up on top of the well he laughed hal hal hal david of sassoun came to fight with me our lisping david had the courage to stand up against the king of egypt let him stay there until his bones rot let him die like a dogl he spat night fell melik slept in his comfortable bed and david was in the well befuddled by the wine and struggling in vain to free himself from the iron rings and chains that wound tighter with every movement he made back in sassoun uncle ohan woke up his wife and said get up david is in trouble i just dreamt it was bright sunlight in egypt dark and misty in sassoun sara said homewrecker let me have some sleep do you sleep for yourself and dream for davicl ohan slept some more and saw another dream he shook her again wife get up i am afraid we lost david i dreamt the star of egypt was very bright the star of sassoun very pale david showed his mettle and it is now up to me to do some thing for him sara said may god wreck your home man go to sleep uncle ohan woke her up for the third time wife get up i said they must

david get up and bring me my clothes and arms sara got out of bed and lit the lamp she brought him his clothes and arms ohan watched david s star from the roof of his house and saw that it was so dim it was dying out as he had dreamt he went to the stable and opened the door his horses were very restless and excited kicking and trying to get out of their stalls he put his hand on the back of the white horse and it caved in he said white horse how soon can you take me to david the horse said give me a measure of barley and we will be there by noon uncle ohan struck him and said i have been feeding you for nothing am i going to reach david or his corpse by noon he laid his hand on his red horse and the belly of the red horse went down too and ohan said hey red horse when can you take me to david give me two measures of barley and we will be there by the time the sun warms up by the time the sun warms up david will be dead ohan laid his hand on his black horse the black horse did not go down ohan kissed him on the head black horse how soon can you take me to david if i feed you three measures of barley god willing with three measures of barley we will be there by the time both of your feet are i n my stirrups the black horse was a fiery horse yvife ohan said bring me my seven buffalohides and seven plowchains sara brought them to him ohan mounted his black horse and was on the mountaintop near leraplain in the twinkling of an eye he tried his strength by ripping up a poplar tree i can still do it he said he wrapped himself tightly in his seven buffalohides and threw the plowchains around his         shoulders and chest so that he would not explode when he shouted in his thundering voice hey david where are you do you hear me you forgot to say your prayer the devil take you or did your tongue dry up in your mouth say for god s sake bread and wine the living god marouta s high mother of god the victory cross on my right arm and shake yourself david heard him

cross on my right arm he shook himself and instantly by god s order the chains and iron rings broke the millstones cracked and splintered and rose skyhigh and anyone who was hit by one of the flying pieces was killed on the spot david sprang out of the well and confronted melik so this is how you entertain me as your guest you will not fool me again melik said i wanted to be sure you will not run away from me until we fought in single combat so i kept you in the well we shall see who is afraid come out of this tent and fight like a man uncle ohan called out from the mountaintop david come here i will be back david said to melik and ran up the moun tain to his uncle he found uncle ohan on his black horse  wrapped in his buffalohides and plowchains with a great poplar tree on his shoulder not far from him was jalali david when i saw your horse without you i thought they had murdered you already jalali heard me and came neighing loudly but i still don t dare go near hirri jalali ran up to david with a joyous whinny and david put his arms around his neck and caressed and kissed him uncle ohan you can go home now i have stopped the slaughter and will fight misra melik in single combat  david fights misra melik    don t you ever forget to say your prayers again and call on marouta s high mother of goel when you are in trouble ohan returned to sassoun and david raced down the moun tain to melik s tent seeing him back on his horse with one hand gripping his mace melik said david my soul you want to fight me when i brought singers and dancers for your wedding still trying to fool me get ready let s go to the arena and let god chooe between us misra melik ordered that his fiery lorse be brought to him he did not eat or drink he dressed up and slung on his arms he mounted and they rode out to the arena at the camp the troops stood around and shouted their approval of the single combat may the better man win the old greybeard saved a hundred thousand men and they favored david wanted to serve him not misra melik as the fighting stopped uncle toros came up with his thirty efoht mounterl wirriors from the other end of the battlefield and told david well clone my boy

him david my brother this is enough for today we can continue tomorrow no strike now david said you stand here then and don t move melik made him change his position he thought he had to go even farther to strike harder he blamed it all on his horse he rode to bagh dad and came back at unimaginable speed to send david to the bottomless pit he struck and the whole world shook as in an earthquake he tore the sky apart as when stormclouds in the spring hare up on mountaintops during a cracking roll of thunder the sun was hlotted out nothing could be seen for a day and night and melik lamented alas a thousand times alts our splendi<l david was du<;t and i turned him to dust when the dmtstorm settled and the sun came out david slapped his head a few times to straighten up his neck which was bent to one side don t worry melik i am still here hey homewrecker let me try once more melik said no you had three chances now it is my tum  which do you prefer my sword or my mace melik

wipe out the armenians i will kill uncle toros too and uncle ohan fool david thinks he will survive three strikes by me misra melik played with his mace weighing three hundred and sixty liters he swung it to the left to the right and twelve liters of fiey sparks poured out of it david shouted melik strike i will wait for your first strike here melik rode all the way to diyarbekir and came back thun dering across the plain while david waited on his horse cover ing himself with his shield one hand on marouta s holy emblem and murmuring a prayer melik yelled in a fierce voice dust you are and to dust you return and struck with savage fury his mace cracked the earth wide open and sounded like forty pairs of buffaloes dragging a plow david disappeared in storm clouds of dust and the king sighed in a mock voice alas a thousand times alas our splendid david was dust and i turned him to dust he waited until the duststorm settled and heard david shout back don t worry melik i haven t turned to dust yet his fiery horse flew up and melik missed him melik said homewrecker i did not go far enough i will strike again he turned his horse around and rode to aleppo he came like a flash and let david have it the earth groaned }folik drove his mace forty cubits into the ground but missed david whose horse sprang up again and david disappeared in the duststorm melik stirred up over the world the king lamented alas a thousand times alas we reared splendid david in our home we took care of him as our very own and now we lost him the poor darling  turned to dust      dayid fights misra meld(         and that s why i missed to make this a fair contest i will go stay in the well they lowered misra melik into the well forty cubits deep and closed its mouth with forty millstones and forty buffalo hides and then spread carpets and his quilt over it melik felt safe in the well david mounted his horse and raced back to dzovasar he came flying with the lightningsword blazing in his hand ismil khatoun ran and stopped him before the tent by baring her bosom david spare him your first strike for the sake of the sweet milk you sucked at my breast david lowered his sword raised it to his lips kissed it touched his forehead with it mother you did not ask melik to spare me his first strike but the first strike is yours david wheeled around and then came storming down from the mountains of sassoun melik s sister ran up and stopped him just before he reached the green tent david when you were a little boy i carried you on my back i held you in my lap i washed your diapers i loved you like your own sister don t strike your second strike for my sake david said sister you did not hold melik back when ie struck me three times with his mace but i will give up my second strike he lowered his sword raised it to his lips kissed it touched his forehead with it and said only one left and this last strike belongs to goel david wheeled around and was off again to tle mountains of armenia ismil khatoun ordered the young brides and the un married girls she brought with her to line up before the tent she said quick play your fiddles quick play your pipes and beat your drums wave your silk handkerchiefs and dance dance for him david is a hotblooded single man he will look at you and miss his last strike the girls bellydanced and sang janiman  david kept his wits about him one god one david one strike he said his  )      profession of faith i believe     and struck the green tent like a thunderbolt shot out of mount ararat he cut through forty millstones he cut through forty buffalohides he split melik s skull in two and his sword came out between the legs of the monster and plunged forty cubits into the very bowels of the earth where the black waters flow if an angel had not held his arm david would have flooded the whole earth with the black waters of the bottomless pit misra melik called from the depths of the well david that was just a flea bite strike again and hurry it s cold clown here david said melik shake yourself move around a bit a brave man strikes only once melik shook himself one half of him fell to one side of the well the other half fell to the other side and that was the end of the king of egypt david said to ismil khatoun tfother open the well and let me see what happened to tielik she said you go away  e vill open it he went away but came back and watched them remove the quilt and the carpets he had cut through the forty millstones he had cut through the forty buffalohides he had cut through and when the well was opened he leaned over his horse and peered down he called melik melik melik there was no answer come out of the well the others said still no answer a rope was lowered into the well and a slave girl slid down she found only the right half of the king s body the other half his left side disappeared in the black waters when the right half was drawn up misra melik s mother his sister and his wife sat by the well and wept over it david kissed his glittering sword and drove it back into the scabbard he put this right half of �lelik s body on ms horse and had it buried on a high place by the christian rite this is my father s half he said after her loud wails ismil khatoun dried her eyes and tmning to david said what is clone is done you   davld fights misra melik   killed him but you too are my son corne david many melik s wife and be king of egypt sassoun is already yours david said i was born without a blemish of pure christian stock and i intend to remain so it would be unlawful to marry a pagan woman she lifted her head and said in an angry voice david you left lvlclik s young wife a widow and may your own wife become a widow before her time david said mother let me take you to sassoun with me from now on you can live with me no david i will never come to sassoun not after you killed your brother he asked that \isra melik s son khosrov be brought to him he himself girt the young boy with the sword and made him king of egypt david commanded that all the remaining troops assemble before him they kissed his hands and feet as they gathered in the arena seated on his great horse david said to them i give you permission to return to your homes go back and give blessings to my father and mother i will not punish any one for fighting against me let us live in peace but i warn you that if you break the peace i am imposing upon you and invade my country again you will not be able to save your lives even if you hide in wells forty cubits deep under forty millstones and forty buffalohides you would have to reckon with this sword that strikes lightning you would have to reckon with david of sassoun david of sassoun the troops shouted as if with one voice may we die for your head and sun may god be with you may god give you long life may he deem your father and mother worthy of paradise ve shall bless you in our hearts as long as we live they passed under his sword before returning to their own cities and lands;   a proudlooking commander rode up to david with whip   i   d\\ id fights misra melik       in hand and said david my brother thank you for sparing my army since both of us are single i propose a pact of per petual friendship between us who are you where are you from david asked i am pajik king of the east david we shall marry some day if you have a son and i have a <laughter let your son marry my <laughter if you have a daughter and i a son jct my son marry your daughter they swore an oath and the king of the east departed with  his � rny �s did the remnants of the other armies singing davi d s praises as they scattered to the four corners of the earth is� il khatoun also took her army and went back to egypt wluch david returned to her as a tributary of sassoun david and uncle toros and his thirtyeight warriors turned their horses around and rode back to sassoun with nothin<y  but an ox cart  david had misra melik s ear stuck at the end of his spear to give it to vergo and his wife as they reached the approaches of sassoun the guards on the watchtowers of the citadel saw a lone horseman followed by thirtynine other horse men and decided it could not be misra melik s army coming up the road these horsemen were too few not the countless hordes of egypt they expected to see through clouds of <lust a scout ran to uncle ohan with the good news and soon the entire population of the city men women children the young and old led by uncle ohan hurried with lutes and drums and bagpipes to meet the returning warriors when david saw them coming down the road and recognized his own countrymen he yelled uncle ohan are you coming against me with an army bigger than mclik s ohan thundered thank god you came back to us safe and sound all these people have been praying for you they were afraid the arabs would be marching up this road to kill our men and carry off our women and children david and his uncle embraced each other co back go back david said i killed misra mek    ohan wiped his brow glory be to god \ve have nothing to fear nny more sassoun is free aunt sara david said you wanted misra melik s ear here it is they took david home like a king he bathed and chan<yed his bloody clothes they washed his horse and groomed him before they tied him in the stall and gave him all the barley he could eat sassoun honored david with a glorious victory feast that lasted seven days the minstrels sang they ate and drank they danced there were fireworks goldenbraids came out of her room and now that her wish came true and david succeeded his father she could enjoy the sunlight and celebrations like this feast instead of staying behind seven locked doors in mourn ing as she had done for years barav said to david welcome home david welcome welcome you see misra melik was not a man to fight with a rusty pocket knife or with a poplar tree david said thank you mamik for your advice ivfore wine david shouted he raised the wine bowl with seven handles to his mouth and drank it down to the last drop then he lay down to sleep for three days and nights uncle ohan said god lit the firelight of sassoun  with david back victorious the whole world belongs to me i think it is time for david to marry i have to find a good wife for our boy vhat do you say my friends does this meet with your approval and the princely men at the feast the great cllieftains nodded and said why not \ve are all for it ohan let the liberator of sassoun marry the girl of his choice  notes evidently the sword remained rustproof in pitcl which is waterproof and mehcrr kept his sword in a large jar filled with pitch because no one could pull it out david does ns though pulung a hair out of dough         ohan s wife (or vergo s wife) asks davicl to bring him melik s left testis as a remecly for sore eyes there are many allusions to it in rough peasant humor  astragali a thorny mountain bush callecl gaz that grows close to the grouncl and is used as kindling or firewood astragalus tragacanthe  evidently feathers or astragali or both were worn on the heacl by messengers or runners in time of war  melik pretends to be asleep ds vol i pp  in other variants he is actually asleep  yeah also in the original texts  these cities or places have no real connection with this episode but are mentioned to indicate distances in a manner of speaking as one re citer explains  janiman a popular song � khosrov ds vol i p  a common name among armenians and iranians and evidently an allusion to chosroes i and chosroes ii two fa mous sassanian kings who fought wars in armenia  it may be that the ox cart carried misra melik s right christian side for burial in sassoun this is suggested by the wording in some variants   cycle three part four  david and the lady khandout all looked up to david after this victorious war he was no longer a homeless orphan whose word di<l not carry much weight in sassoun he came back from the war a changed man he filled out he became a mighty giant an<l any woman who saw his beautiful eyes his red cheeks his fine nose mouth and features went crazy over him mamik i have no mother he said to barav   \vill you come and live with me as my mother she said david i am already your motler i do not have to live with you to keep you informed of what is going on when there is any news i will come and tell you from now on you have nothing to worry about flourish prosper enjoy life you are no longer a fool but a sensible young man ask ohan she said to have your father s hall made ready for you live in your fatler s hall you will find meherr s chests standing there fold your father s clothes and keep them in his chests and hang your sword on the wall with your own hands you need a groom for your

4,Vardan Aygektsi,from the book of the fox  the lion the wolf and the fox  the lion the wolf and the fox together went hunting they found a ram a sheep and a lamb at dinner time the lion said to the wolf divide our prey among us and the wolf said o your majesty god has already divided it the ram is for you the sheep is for me and the lamb is for the fox the lion enraged slapped the wolf on the jaw making its eye out the wolf began to cry bitterly then the lion turned to the fall fox and asked him to divide the prey himself and the fox said oh king god has already divided it the ram is for your lunch the sheep is for your snack and the lamb is for your supper and the lion replied oh shrewd fox who taught you to divide  so equitably and the fox said i learned it from the wolf s eyes that came out of their sockets the wine  a king who had a son ordered his regents to take the latter every day and entertain him and so they did one day one of the regents who had taken the heir out as usual returned to the palace and left the king s son was quite drunk; when he came out he fell into the garbage and was killed the king then gave his orders to close down all the vineyards and destroy all the barrels and so they did a widow who had a son retained her winepress and wine; every morning and evening she offered her son a glass of wine with his meals the widow s son went one evening and killed the king s lion which was roaming about in the street hearing the news the king proclaimed whoever comes and relates what happened i shall not punish him  vardan aygektsiaghvesaghk (the book ofthe fox) (yerevan )  translated by the editors of the p resent volume   vard aygektsi i    j part  tenth to fourteenth cety  and thus came the widow and her son the king asked how he had killed the lion; and the widow s son told the king that when he was out in the sheet at night he met the lion and killed it and the mother said that she nourished her son with wine but within moderation then the king gave his orders that people could plant grapes and drink the wine in such a way that they would kill lions instead of getting killed in the garbage  the cane and the trees  a king was out roaming and strolling over the valleys and mountains he observed that there were numerous giant trees all broken and shattered and there was only a cane solidly erect and undamaged and the king said oh cane tell me how you could stand so upright and un harmed when all these huge trees are deshoyed the cane replied oh your majesty when the storm began the trees stood proudly against the wind and the wind shattered them whereas i bowed obeying the wind s whim and there we are i am still erect  the wise prince and the widow  once upon a time there was a wicked prince in the same city lived a widow who had been disturbed and taxed heavily by the prince the widow however prayed for the prince that he might live a long and peaceful life when they informed the prince that the widow prayed thank fully for his wicked actions the prince at once went to see her and said oh woman i have never been benevolent to you why do you then pray for me the widow replied your father was an evil person i cursed him and he passed away you replaced him and became even more evil therefore i am afraid that you may die and your son may outdo you in evil deeds  the wise soldier a certain wise soldier went to war but he had no legs another soldier asked him  you miserable man where are you going they ll kill you at once for you can t escape the handicapped soldier replied you stupid man i don t go to war to escape but to remain there to fight and triumph  the donkey the foal and the pig  a certain man used to transport barley from the threshing ground to the barn on the back of his donkey and the donkey s foal used to walk back and forth beside his mother inside the barn tied up next to the fodder and with continuous access to the barley was a pig which ate very well indeed and was growing very fat on day the foal asked his mother why is the pig allowed to eat barley all day long without doing any work while we who work hard carrying it are allowed to eat it only once a clay his mother answered listen to me son just wait patiently for one more week and you will have your answer; in fact you will see for yourself a week later as the donkey and her foal were walking home laden down as usual the foal which was walking ahead of his mother heard a horrible squealing noise the pig was being slaugh tered the foal was frightened and ran back to his mother his mother said don t feel bad about the pig my son he is settling the account for his barley as they drew closer to home on the next hip back from the threshing ground the foal lifted up his foreleg and addressed his mother mother please check to see if there is a grain of barley stuck in my hoof lest i be required to pay the same price as the pig the moral of this tale is that he who benefits freely from the labor of others and grows fat upon it like the pig will render ac count to the temporal judges of this world with his death and will also answer with body and soul at the fearful judgment hereafter  the crow and the fox  a crow that was dying of hunger stole a piece of cheese from a farmer and alighted on a high rock to enjoy his meal a fox at the foot of the rock saw the cheese in the crow s mouth and began to praise him as follows all glory to the god of animals who has created such a crea ture as radiant as the sun and as beautiful as the moon how    part  tenth to forteeth centy  venerable his appearance and how his feathers shine as brilliantly as the stars if only i could be sure that he had a powerful voice i would anoint him king of the universe when he heard these praises the crow lost his equanimity and puffed himself up with pride he forgot all about the cheese and thought to himself it is true that i am beautiful and what is more i do have a powerful voice and to prove it he spread his wings and crowed as loudly as he could the cheese fell from his beak and dropped at the feet of the fox at this the fox remarked your voice is indeed good and loud you have all the qualities needed to be a king even in abundance except for one thing you have no brains at all if you cannot even keep hold of a morsel of cheese that is in your mouth how could you ever keep hold of a kingdom remember this fable and never allow yourself to be deceived by flattery  the goats and the wolves  all of the goats came together in a big assembly and sent a message to the race of wolves saying why do you bear animosity toward us make peace with us we beseech you just as the kings of the nations do when they received this message the wolves assembled with great rejoicing and sent a long letter in reply together with many gifts this is what their letter said we accept your good advice and give thanks to god for this is an occasion of great joy and peace but know  wise ones that the source and origin of the strife behveen us are the goatherds and the dogs only get rid of them and peace will soon follow when the goats heard this message they said the wolves do right to kill us for indeed whenever they come near us the goatherds and the dogs chase them away so they dismissed the goatherds and the dogs and wrote a letter to the wolves in which they bound themselves with a solemn oath to coexist with them in undying friendship for a hundred years the goats then blithely   this fable is familiar to french readers in the wellknown poem le corbeau et le renard by seventeenthcentury writer jean de la fontaine maitre corbeau sur un arbre perche tenait en son bee un fromage    vnrdanaygektsi i   spread out over the mountains and the fields grazing in the most beautiful places eating of the choicest grass drinking of the coolest waters laughing and leaping for joy and thanking god that they lived in such blessed times the wolves waited for a hundred days and then one pack after another fell upon the goats and devoured them the moral of this tale is that it is the nature of the human heart to be set firmly in enmity and hatrednation against nation tribe against tribe and man against manand it is as unlikely that love and peace will ever be established between them as it is behveen rich and poor the wolf and the donkey  a wolf encountered a fat donkey and wanted to devour it good wolf said the donkey i have stepped on a nail and i beg you before you eat me to remove it from my hind hoof i realize that it is god s will that you should eat me but that bothersome nail is causing me a great deal of pain when the wolf went behind the donkey to remove the nail the donkey gave a powerful kick and crushed the wolf s muzzle the wounded wolf sat back and lamented bitterly truly i have suffered all for generations we have been butchers and now i have become a shoer of donkeys the moral of this tale is that whoever attempts to practice a trade which he has not studied or which is not appropriate to the circumstances will live to regret it with many tears the eagle and the arrow  an eagle was hit by an arrow as he soared through the skies wondering who was responsible he looked at the arrow and saw that it was fletched with an eagle s feather woe is me he said i am the cause of my own undoing   ,1841

others the fellows of our student days therefore even though i was the youngest among his pupils and the task was beyond my capacities i who had had the fortune of being his special pupil nevertheless immediately hastened to write what had been suggested compelled by the clear mandate which had been given me and we ask all those who gave us that mandate to assist us in our task by their prayers and to commit us to divine grace so that we may sail successfully and unerringly over the boundless waves of the sea of doctrine  ii  but let us begin by examining whether it is permissible to vvrite about the lives of perfect men for our part we do not wish to engage in disputatious eloquence relying on our mvn thoughts; but we wish to prove the contrary u simply by giving examples for god the bountiful has been so gracious to his beloved that not only has he deemed them worthy of the glorious and exalted reward thrnugh endless etemity for their virtuous lives but he has also caused them to be extolled to the heavens here in this world in the course of this transitory life in order that they might in general shine with both spiritual and earthly luster moreover the books of moses  testify to the nobility of blessed men and the firmness of their true faith the beauty of godly and god fearing conduct and the radiance of a good life for in them one man is called righteous because he made an acceptable sacrifice; another remains alive disdaining alldevouring death because of his good works; a third  is preserved along with every breathing thing in a ship for a period of one year on the godsent scourge of a boundless mountainhigh sea because of his perfect righteousness; and a fourth  is justified through his suddenly found faith and  ie the contrary of the opinion that it is not permissible  ie the pentateuch the first five books of the old testament traditionally attributed to vloses [eds]  the reference is probably to abel; cf gen  (also cf matt ; heb ) [eds]  the reference is probably to enoch who after living  years was trans lated to heaven for enoch walked with god; and he was not for god took him (gen ) [eds]  noah cf gen     [eds]  the reference is probably to abraham with whom god made a covenant cf gen ; ; ;  [eds]     i the heritage efarmenian literature  drawing near to goel becomes an oracle and ally of god and inherits the promise of the prosperity to come many others came to know god in similar ways and their nobility has been described in all the holy books in like manner blessed paul in his epistle to the hebrews      praises the true faith of such persons by name whereby each has received according to his attainments rewarding consolation from goel the bountiful giver of all things he even offers as an example the hospitality which rahab the evildoer showed to the spies i s af ter noting how numerous such persons are he has actually revealed the names of only a few of them however and omitted others judging the time insufficient to recount them all in their prope   order he then records in a general manner the tribulations of such persons and their submissive martyrdoms which he considers more desirable than all the riches of the world so also all of the inspired books record the brave deeds of m �n f   a� the victories which some of them obtained through faith m dvme religion and the bravery some of them displayed in battles and wars in the manner of the world such as the stories of nimrod samson and davicl  moreover a few men are praised for teir natural wisdom as well as for their divine wisdom as in the stones of joseph in egypt and daniel in babylon they also tell of advisors to mighty kings who advised on the state of worldly affairs at the same time as they imparted knowledge to everyone about goel the �ord of all in praise of the wisdom of such persons the prophet himself has this to say what are you wiser than daniel is no secret beyond your grasp and this is not all the power of the saints is proclaimed by the fact that angels \vee dispatched as emissaries to declare daniel greatly beloved and in galilee the holy mother of the lord blessed among women   heb  [eds]  cf heb  [eds]  gen  [eds]  judg  to  [eds]   sam  to ;  sam  to ;  kings  and  [eds]  ezek  [eds]  dan  [eds]  luke  [eds]  koiun i   and this is not to mention the praise bestowed upon each other by comrades whose nobility the lord himself loudly proclaimed before angels and men revealing not only their known works but also the radiance in the recesses of their hearts thus he acknowledged hospitable abraham as an intimate servant and after delivering to him a promise related to him what was to befall sodom similarly he praised the longsuffering job prior to his encounter with satan calling him a man of blameless and upright life who fears god and sets his face against wrongdoing more over all the religious books speak of the close intimacy between the great moses and goel divine revelation even mentions his youthful intelligence and it has not neglected to mention the advice of the alien j ethro and so from out of divine revelation there shine forth the good works of all the devout wise men whose blessed names are too numerous to list and he has caused to blossom forth the noble deeds not only of those who lived before the birth of the only begotten son the savior of all but also the deeds of those who came after it even exalting them in his luminous gospel in the beatitudes  and praising not only his own twelve and the forerunner  but also the uprightness of belief of others who approached the truth of the faith thus he says of nathanael that in him there was no guile  and he says that the centurion s faith was so great that its equal was not to be found in lsrael  but christ praises not only great deeds he exalts the humble and so he also praises the lesser deeds even more thus he thinks highly of the pouring of a little ointment and states that the memory of her who poured it shall be preached under heaven  l vloreover he   cf gen  [eds]  job  [eds]  jethro ivioses  fatherinlaw was a priest ofmidian his advice to moses is reported in exod  [eds]  matt  [eds]  ie st john the baptist [bn]  john  [eds]  matt ; luke  [eds]  cf matt  tradition identifies this woman as st mary magdalene [eds]     i the heritage of/lrenin literature  says that the faith of the canaanite woman is greatjj and praises tl�e generosit � of her who contributed only two mites finding her gift more praiseworthy than those of the wealthy as for paul who dedicated himself to spreading the luminous or�ler established by christ he was called a vessel chosen to bear his wondrous name in the world therefore that blessed man upon beholding the loftiness of the grace with which his faith and that of all the saints had been rewarded began loudly to glorify god who wherever he goes makes us in christ partners of his triumph and through us is spreading the knowledge of himself like a sweet smell everywhere but he is even bolder when he asks who shall lay anything to the charge of god s electj and th� blessed apostles received from the lord permission to record the virtues of all their fellow workers a few examples can be found in the holy gospels there are a few others in the book of acts which was written by blessed luke and there are still others in th� general epistles similarly in his fourteen epistles st paul speaks of his fellow apostles and coworkers making them participants in his joy and at the end of each of his epistles he extends greetings to them inquiring about them by name and quotes the gospel in praise i one of them and not only is he thankful for their assistance to him but he also has high praise for the christian hospitality of his host� and gratefully asks god to revard them for their kindness and to all the churches he declares the nobility of the chosen disciples who preached the truth of the gospel not only the men but also the women he makes all these declarations not for the sake of praise or pride but in order that they might serve as examples to those who are to come to make them all zealous in good deedsi he sa)s•

readiness to serve the saints he exhorts others by rousing their envy and he even permits them to be unreservedly jealous of the virtue of the just saying your jealousy should be for the honorable gifts you see in a man of honor   he exhorts them moreover to strive to be like both himself and the lord further he aspires to live with them all according to christ s example look unto jesus  says he the author and finisher of our faith   and again remember your leaders who preached the word of goel to you and    imitate their faith and finally let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus luke also says this at the beginning of the book of acts while beloved james brother of jesus taking as his examples the entire phalanx of the saints as well as the lord lover of the saints states in his epistle for your example brothers in submitting with patience take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord    you have heard of job s perseverance and have seen what the lord finally brought about   it is evident from all this that the chosen ones who love god are praised sometimes by the lord himself sometimes by the angels and sometimes by others not for the sake of pride but for the purpose of arousing each other s envy so that encouraged by each other we may succeed in the accomplishment of good works the goal set for us by blessed paul to come unto the measure

was the name of the man to whom we referred at the beginning of our account whose story we have been eager to write he was from the village of hatsekats in the province of taron the son of a blessed man named vardan from childhood he had been tutored in greek literature and when he anived at the court of the arsacid kings in armenia major he entered the royal service as a member of the royal secretariat while a man named aravan was hazarapet of the janel of armenia mesrop was well versed in secular laws and was esteemed by his men for his mastery of the military art although in the royal service he nevertheless devoted himself eagerly to the reading of the scriptures and by this means he was soon enlightened gaining profound insight into matters related to the divine ordinances and adorning himself with every preparation he served the princes iv subsequently in compliance with the precepts of the gospel he devoted himself to the service of goel the lover of man thencefor ward he

his bed often in the twinkling of an eye he would end a night s pleasant rest and muchneeded sleep in standing vigil and this not a few times and a few of the men he encountered were moved to join him becoming his pupils in this evangelical exercise and thus overcoming all temptations with the courage of his will and growing in radiance he became known and beloved by both god and man  v taking his faithful pupils with him the blessed one went to the wild and uncultivated regions of goghtn  he was met by the ruler of goghtn a pious man whose name was shabit a gracious and hospitable man who treated him devoutly in a manner worthy of an apostle of the christian faith and the blessed one began at once to exercise the art of evangelism preaching in the province with the faithful cooperation of the ruler and winning them all away from their native traditions and satanic idolatry converting them to obedience to christ and as he implanted the word of life in them many miracles   s too i{

have great sorrow and constant pain in my heart for my brethren and kinsmen  he was thus surrounded and entangled with sad worries and engulfed by waves of apprehension about how he might find a solution to the problem  vi after turning this problem over for many clays he arose and went to the holy catholicos of armenia major whose name was sahak and he found him preoccupied with the same concern they came cordially together anc beseeched god with earnest prayers early every morning that all men might attain the salvation brought by christ and this they did for many clays then as a boon from god the gracious the council of blessed monks out of devotion to the service of the land gathered to devise an alphabet for the armenian nation they proceeded with much inquiry and exploration and muph toil eventually they revealed the foremost object of their search to the king of the armenians whose name was vramshapuhs the king told them of a man named daniel a syrian bishop of noble lineage who had unexpectedly come into possession of the letters of an armenian alphabet when the king told them about daniel s discovery they prevailed upon him to make the necessary arrangements he accorclingly sent a man named vahrich with messages to a priest namec habel who was an intimate of bishop daniel when habel heard what vvas happening he hastened to daniel and with daniel s help he first became familiar with the letters then he took them from him and sent them to the king in the jan� of armenia the letters reached his hands in the fifth year of his  rom

the object of their search the blessed custodians requested the king to prnvide young children upon whom they might experiment with the alphabet and when it had been taught to many of them the king commanded that these letters be used for instruction everywhere thus the blessed one attained the noble rank of teacher and taught for two years using these letters but they found that these letters were inadequate to form all the syllables of the armenian language especially since they proved essentially to have been buried and then resurrected from other languages and they found themselves once more with the same misgivings and searched for a solution for some time  vii therefore in the fifth year of king vramshapuh s reign on the authority of the king and with the consent of st sahak the blessed mashtots took his leave with a kiss of holiness and taking with him a group of young men travelled to the region of aram  to two assyrian cities one of which was called eclessa and the other

father of new and wonderf u l offspring the letters of the armenian language which he then and there quickly designed named put in order and devised the syllabication of he then took leave of the holy bishop and he and his pupils went to the city of samosata where he was accorded great honors by the bishop and the church in that city he found a hellenic scribe named ropanos by whose hand all the variations of the letters the thin and heavy strokes the long and the short the single letters and the diphthongs were devised after this he turned to the task of translation with the help of two of

encouragement to the students and taking with him letters of good tidings and god s gracious gift  he set out with his group and after safely spending time in several inns with profound joy he all

not say that l\rlesrop was happier than f moses but that moses  happiness was much less than his for as moses who had seen god descended from the mountain holding the commandments which god had inscribed he was filled with sadness because of the sinful people  vvho had turned away from providence and become base apostates bowing down before their molten idol to the great distress of the bearer of the command ments causing him to lament as is clear from his smashing of the tablets but the blessed subject of this essay experienced no such dis appointments; on the contrary filled with spiritual support he was confident that he would be received with eagemess and in antic ipation of the joy with which he would be received the very inns on his road welcomed him as the bearer of good tidings let no one consider us bold for what we have said we may be subject to censure for our analogy between a very modest man and the great moses who spoke with god but we feel justified by the

after warm greetings amid som lds of joy and the singing of hymns and doxologies they returned to the city and the days passed in festive joy  x he then immediately obtained permission from the king to endeavor to teach in the savage regions of the lviedes who were difficult to communicate with not only because of their devilish satanic and fiendish character but also because of their very crude corrnpt and harsh language they undertook to civilize them and they made them the offspring of many generations intelligible eloquent educated and informed of godly visdom in fact they became so immersed in the laws and commandments that it was impossible to distinguish them from their fellow countrymen  xi and from that time forward they continued the husbandry of god s work beginning with the arts of evangelization translat ing writing and teaching particularly since they had before their eyes the lord s lofty injunctions and the example of god s exalted commandments which were given to blessed moses concerning all things that were in order that he might inscribe them in a book to be preserved for the eternity to come as well as similar commands given to other prophets take a large writing tablet said he and write on it in common script; and elsewhere now go and inscribe this on a tablet write it in a book but david indicates even more clearly that this divine command should apply to all nations saying this will be written down for future generations  and that the lord will record in the register of  probably a distortion of yeraskh [bn]  isa  [eds]  isa  [eds]  ps

time our blessed and wonderful land of armenia became truly worthy of admiration for there by the hands of two colleagues suddenly in an instant the lawgiver moses the pro cession of the prophets

in time but also those of the eternity which had preceded and those that were to come the beginning and the end and all the divine traditions  xii  and as they became certain that things were firmly established they were emboldened even further to gather more pupils for the newly discovered learning in order to instruct educate and train them to preach to illiterate men and pupils from all parts and provinces of armenia came in large numbers to the newly opened fountain of divine knowledge for the grace of god s command ments gushed forth for the armenians in the province of ayrarat at the

among whom was a saintly and devout man named samuel who became bishop to the royal court and vhen he had organized the work of god s worship in all parts of georgia he took leave of them and returned to armenia where he met sahak the catholicos of the armenians and re counted all that had transpired and together they glorified god and exalted christ  xvi he then went back to visit the places he

all to valk in the path of life he then thought of the other half of the armenian nation which was under the rule of the king of the horoms and he hastened and vent to the territory of the greeks

everywhere after receiving many gifts they finally arrived at their destina tion at once they visited the sparapet of armenia and presented themselves armed with caesar s sacra rescripta and when the sparapet had received the sacra rescripta bearing caesar s seal he hastened to carry out the decree at once he therefore dispatched messengers to the provinces in that half of the armenian nation ordering many youths to be gathered and provisions made for their maintenance at suitable places and the blessed one resumed his teaching educating those who had been gathered then he under took to examine the uncouth and stubborn sect of the borboritons and when he found no other way to discipline them he began to use the miseryinaicting stick with very severe chastisements impris onments tortures and fetters and when they remained deprived of salvation even then they were driven out of the land scourged branded smeared in soot and subjected to various indignities the blessed one however devoted himself to his educational task and he organized and completed it and having acquired many noble books by the church fathers he further deepened his knowledge of the faith and was filled with all goodness then an elderly man an albanian named benjamin came to visit them and mesrop investigated and examined the barbaric diction of the albanian language and then through his usual god given keenness of mind he invented an alphabet which he suc cessfully organized and put in order through the grace of christ after this he departed from the bishops princes and all the churches of the land he appointed two of his pupils the first of whom was named yenovk and the second danan as over seers over the faithful; these clerics whom he commended to god and placed there were effective men in the evangelical service and with many of his pupils he went to the territories of greater   /lghvan in armenian a native of caucasi albania a country northeast of armenia the caucasian albanians were friendly to the armenians [bn]  kori i   kaghak he presented armenia and when he had arrived at nor armenian king whose himself to the saintly bishop sahak to the  and to the nobles and related to them the name was artashes in those regions and he things wrought by the grace of god tual consolation remained there a few days distributing spiri  xvi i  to go to the ter and then he bade farewell to them in order arrived in their country ritory of the albanians and when he had saintly bishop of the the and reached the royal precincts he saw their king whose name albanians whose name was jeremiah and lity received him in the was arsvagh who together with the nobi when they inquired name of christ with utter compliance and the two associates he explained the reason for his coming and readiness to adopt the the king and the bishop expressed their of youths be gathered alphabet and ordered that a large number that schools be opened from provinces and places in the realm and their livelihood in suitable places and provisions made for led and bore results and soon after this order was actually fulfil e books whereby divin the bishop jeremiah began the translation of ful

promptly com moreover the godfearing king of the alba ping nation disavow and manded that the satanic and devilworship it to the sweet yoke free itself from its old superstitions and subm of christ and had done all that and when they had accomplished this went to the region of was needed and what he desired mesrop ed task of proselytizing by baghas where he was aided in his sacr hegh he then took leave the saintly bishop whose name was mus church of the albanian king the bishop and the seers over them along and he named a few of his pupils as over e was jonathan and who with one of the royal priests whose nam uction had shown much eagerness for his instr  artashes was the son of vramshapuh and the last arsacid king on the throne of armenia [bn]    j the heritage  ofarmenian literature  and after committing them and himself to god s providential mercy he resumed his journey from the territories of albania to the land of georgia  xviii he arrived on the other side of the gardmanian valley he was met by the ruler of gardmank a man named khurs who welcomed him with godloving piety and placed himself and his office at the service of the vardapet after enjoying the richness and the essence of his teaching he helped the blessed one on his way as he set out towards his destination at that time a man named ardziugh became king of georgia and caused learning to advance and flourish and mesrop visited all the pupils and exhorted them to persevere in righteousness at that time the ruler of tashir an excellent godloving man named ashusha placed himself and his entire province at his dis posal and the dissemination of his teaching was no less successful there than it had been in other provinces he left them in the care of the saintly bishop samuel mentioned above and returned to the territories of armenia major visiting the usual places he warmly greeted saint sahak and all those he saw and also told them of his latest endeavors when they had heard him they praised god for his bounties  xix then the blessed ones turned their attention to the improve ment of the literature of their nation as before sahak the great began to write and to translate and it so happened that they dispatched to the city of eclessa in the territories of the syrians two of their pupils who were brethren the first named hovsep vvho is mentioned above and the second yeznik from the village of goghb in the province of ayrarat for the purpose of translating from syriac to armenian and writing clown the traditions of the church fathers  presentday lori in armenia [bn]  ie yeznik koghbatsi who collaborated with catholicos sahak on the translation of the bible from greek and authored the book refutation ofthe sects see chapter  in this volume [bn] and [eds]  koriim i   upon arriving at their destination therefore the translators carried out their orders and sent their translations to the excellent fathers then they went to the territory of the greeks where they studied and became proficient translators from the greek language later a few more brethren went to the territory of the greeks the first of whom was named ghevondes and the second was i koriun and as they drew near to constantinople they joined yeznik and as most intimate companions they performed their spiritual task together then they returned to the land of armenia bringing with them authentic copies of divinely inspired scripture and many subsequent writings by the worthy church fathers along with the canons of nicaea and ephesus  and they placed before the fathers the testaments of the holy church which they had brought with them and blessed sahak who had translated all the ecclesiasti cal books and the wisdom of the church fathers from the greek language into armenian once more undertook with yeznik the comparison of those random hurried translations made from the versions that were available at the time with the authentic versions and they translated many commentaries on the bible and so the fathers passed their time day and night in the reading of books and thus served as good examples to their stu dious assistants especially in respect to the exhortations of god s messengers the first of which commands have the book of this law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night  and the second of which similarly commands devote yourself to the public reading of the scriptures to exhortation and to teaching do not neglect the spiritual endowment given you    make these matters your business make them your absorbing interest    by doing so you will save both yourself and your hearers   ie the work of translation [eds]  ie the decrees issued by the first and third ecumenical councils held in nicaea in  and ephesus in  respectively [eds]  josh  (jerusalem bible) the sentiment is echoed in ps  (beatus vir) his delight is in the law of the lord; it is his meditation day and night and in several other psalms [eds]   tim  [eds]    j the heritage of/lrein literature  xx  then t�e blessed �iashtots with his excellent erud ition began to com� ose diverse easily understood and grac ious sermons f ull of the light and essence of the prophetic book s and of illustrations of true evangecal faith he then created and organized many exan� ples and allusions from the ephemera l things of the world relatmg to the afterlife resurrection and hope  in order to make th�m intelligi �le even to fools and to thos e distracted by secular thmgs to revive and awaken them and to persuade them of the rewards that have been promised  xxi  and thus through ut his lifetime in summ er and winter night � and clay fe rles and without hesitation he bore with his evangeli � � ca  and upnght l �e the name ofjesus the savi or of all thrnughout  at mema georgia and albania before kings  princes and all the pagans and with no contradiction from oppo nents and he spiritu ally adorned every man with the vestments of christ and he saved many who had been imprisoned and in chain s by wresting them away from the hands of tyrants by the migh ty power of christ and he tre up many unjust contracts and throu gh the doctrine of consolat on gave to many who were in mou rning and in despair expectatmn and lope in the appearance of the glory of almighty god �nd our savior jesus christ and in shor t he changed them all by brgg them under god s law  xxi i  � �d �g �in he �ounded an inestimable number of monastic commumties  habted as well as in uninhab <  ted places mnu  merable • • • cnmu tes  lowlands mountains cave � s and clois ters from  tune to �une he showed himself as an exam ple to them he took a fe�v pupls from each of the monasteries to retir e into the mountains  with hun there to live in caves they seclu ded themselves in cav erns and ended each day by receiving their daily nourishment from her�s and thus they subjected themselve s to painful debilities )�avmg especially in view the consolation of the apostolic word; when i am weak [for christ] then i am strnn  g    and i       cor  [eds]  korii  j  happy to boast of my weaknesses because then the power of christ will rest upon me   there they did not become drunk with wine  but were filled with the spirit and their hearts were ever ready to praise the glory of god with hymns there they received training by reading spiri tually instructive books there the master instructed and exhorted the chosen to go forward to attain the crown offered by christ there they were fired with goelworshipping service there they prayed tearfully and pleaded to god the lover of mankind that the lives of all men might be reconciled and thus he performed his spiritual art in desolate places for many clays until the priests of the region called on him to come to their assistance for some worthy purpose in the grace of christ then without hesitation he hurried with his assistants whatever happened to be the problem and through the power of god solved it and through his continuous preaching he caused the streams of the faith to flow abundantly in the hearts of his hearers and he did this throughout his lifetime both for his ovvn sake and for the world s for all true teachers earnestly strive to turn their virtues into examples for their pupils especially stressing the example of the lord the only wise god jesus began to work and to teach  the lord often took his disciples aside and made his allpowerful person an example to imperfect men such as when he pronounced the beatitudes on mount tabor and handed down the lord s prayer on the same mountain and while his disciples were sailing on the sea of tiberias and again during the feast of the unleavened bread having secluded himself on the mount of olives he offered up his night prayer here it is evident without much scrutiny that the lord of all strove not for himself but to teach the world as an example for all who obey and for that reason he said watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation  and if earthen man is deficient in the knowledge of the minor arts how much more may he be considered lacking in the art vhich enables him to speak with god thus blessed paul states   cor  [eds]  eph  [eds]  acts  [eds]  lvlatt  {eds]  t     the heritage of aneia literature  that since all are ignorant the omniscient spirit comes to their aid and intercedes for them with groans beyond all utterance  yet when we hear that jesus began to work and to teach  we must understand that he did really work and teach not that he simply made a present of his knowledge and it is to be understood that the purpose of the intercession of the saints and that of the holy spirit is to teach us to intercede for one another for there are no degrees in the sight of god but there we are all of equal rank when the blessed apostles having received their example from the teacher of truth first applied it to their imperfect selves and then transmitted it to their disciples they greatly exalted the glory of christ sometimes in private and sometimes in the assembly of the people for in reality it would have been far more beneficial to them to retreat from all worldly interests to withdraw themselves and to engage only in the worship of god as was the practice of the prophets who devoted themselves to the service of the divine faith in mountains deserts and caves similarly all the church fathers who succeeded the disciples endowed as they were with piety have served as examples to us who have followed them and so the blessed one assumed this honored tradition and similarly admonished all who came near him with the same exhortation and in this manner they lived for a long time richly filled by the grace of divine gifts every day rising early in the morning for the same purpose with perseverance  xxiii at that time the false books and inane traditions of a man named theodore vere brought to the land of armenia the synod of the church fathers had warned sahak and mesrop those faithful glorifiers of god about these things in writing; and the latter in the interest of truth quashed them and sent them beyond their borders so that no satanic smoke might obscure the luminous faith  rom  [eds]  act    [eds] llo theodore l\tlopsuestia the teacher of nestorius who was patriarch of constantinople ( ) before being deprived of his office as a heretic by the council ofephesus the nestorians believed thatjesus was two separate and distinct persons one human and one divine and opposed the title l\tlother of god for the virgin contending that she gave birth only to jesus  human person [bn] and [eds]  koii i in  xxiv  after that the blessed sahak righteous to the end rich in years and gracious with the goodness of godgiven rewards in the village of blur in the province of bagrevand  in the first year of jazdegerd ii son of vram king of persia at the end of the month of navasard   even as they were celebrating the birthday of the blessed one at the hour of two in the course of the administration of extreme unction expired in christ with prayers pleasing to god he recalled the words of the prophet into your hands i commit my spirit    and those of the blessed stephen lord jesus receive my spirit  in addition he commended those he left behind to god his godloving executors his own pupils the chief of whom was named yeremia a saintly and devout man together with the assistance of a noble lady named dustr the wife of vardan whom we have mentioned before and a large group of saintly men hastily made all preparations raised him up with psalms doxologies and hymns and after travelling day and night for several days arrived in taran more precisely at the village of ashtishat    and there at the altar of all the martyrs they placed him with sweetsmelling incense of all kinds in the tomb of the saints and sealed it with the seal of christ  and after performing the customary rites everyone returned here every year they gathered together at that month to observe his memory  xxv  but his blessed colleague by which i mean mashtots inflamed with longing was immersed in sad tearful and heartfelt lame�  tations and deep mourning for if the holy apostle says that his

ps   the vulgate numbeung) jerusalem bible translation is quoted here these words were repeated by chnst from the cross (luke ) [eds]  acts  [eds]   a village where the celebrated pagan temple that housed the statues of armenia s gods and godesses vahagn anahit and astghik was once located after the adoption of christianity it became the property of gregory the illummator [bn]  ie the cross    / the heritage of/lnnenian literature  soul was restless upon not finding his fellow worker timothy    how much more sorrow do those who are left behind feel for those who have departed forever but even though the sorrow caused by loneliness would not permit him to be cheerful he nevertheless with the grace of god faultlessly continued his evangelism and the administration of the holy church striving even harder and exhorted everyone to be undaunted in goodness and day and night with fasting prayer and supplications he admonished everyone in a loud voice reminding them of the godordained commandments and he took upon himself some of the most arduous disciplines of monastic life above all because he was advanced in years and thinking of his last days he would not allow his eyes to be overcome with sleep nor his eyelids with drowsiness until he attained rest in the lord  xxvi  and while he was thus reviving the religious fervor of those who were near him and sending many messages of advice and exhortation to all the provinces in that same year six months after the death of blessed sahak    while the saintly master was with the armenian army which was located in nor kaghak in ayrarat leading the same godly life he reached the saintly end of those vho have been summoned by christ after an illness of a few days on the th day of the month of mehekan as he was about to become separated from his beloved pupils in order to join christ s legion freed from his pains and regaining consciousness he arose and sat in the midst of those around him and with hands upraised to heaven he commended to god s grace those who were left behind and asked assistance for them and the names of the principal disciples who had gathered there are first hovsep whom we mentioned at the beginning and second tadik a temperate man most heedful of the directions of  the reference seems to be to titus rather than timothy since it appears to refer to the passage in  cor  i had no rest in my spirit because i found not t itus my brother [bn] and [eds]  the death of sahak occurred on september   and that ofmesrop on february   the two months were in the same year according to the armenian calendar [bn] and [eds]  korit/ /   the master among the military the first was named vahan of the amatuni clan who was commanderinchief of armenia major and the second hmayak    of the mamikonian clan both excellent and pious men heedful of the master s instructions and as the hands of the saint were upraised to heaven a luminous vision esembling a cross was seen over the mansi n where the blessed one was dying this was seen by everyone with his own eyes and was not just a story circulated by his followers and to the blessed ones he left a legacy of love and unity and he went to his rest blessing those both far and near and offering pleasing prayers to christ  vahan and hnayak joined by the populace havmg made all the arrangements lifted the deceased up with psalms and doxolo gies and spiritual joy and with burning candles and flaming torches sweetsmelling incense and brilliant candlesticks prece�ed � y l� minous crucifixes they went to oshakan  and there laid hn  the tomb of the martyrs and performed the funeral rites then the vision disappeared and they all returned to their places  three years later however vahan amatuni �vas able with christloving zeal to build a marvelous church with fit� el; hewn sculptured stones and inside the church he erected tl� e samt s tomb for the altar of the lifegiving body and blood of chnst he prepared graceful vessels of varied colors decorated with shining gold silver and precious stones and together with the assemblec r�onk�  he  transferred the body of mash tots the witness of christ s religion of the cross to the tomb in the church and for the glory of god they appointed one of his pupils a temperate and piou� man named tadik along with his brethren as servants of the samt who had attained the state of bliss  xxvii  the principal administrators and vicars had been named by the departed church fathers the first of these was hovsep chief of the council and the second another pupil named hovnan a truly  the brother of vardan mamikonian [bn]  even though a number of martyrs and confessors had already been bur  ed at oshakan it became famous as the final resting place ofthe creator of the armean alphabet [bn]    i the heritage  efarmenian litemture  saintly truthloving man it so happened that after the passing of the saint this man victoriously withstood for christ many and varied torments and sorrows in chains at ctesiphon   in singlehanded combat against redoubled tyranny thereby meriting the title of confessor and returned to his administra tive tasks in armenia as for the beneficent vahan who rendered unexpected assis tance to all through the grace of christ our god he became a true spiritual son of the worldreforming fathers and was found worthy to be a close participant in their life  kori \ s   years jazdegerd for the persian king kerman reigned for six in the first year twentyone vram for eighteen and the saint died of the reign of vram s son jazdegerd ii in the fourth thus mesrop s service in the holy faith bega n of vram s son year of king kennan and lasted until the first year ed in the eighth jazdegerd ii and the armenian alphabet was creat year of j azdegerd i  glory to christ the lover of mankind  xxviii  and so the fathers vent to their reward as we have written we have not gleaned this record of them from old tales; on the contrary we have looked on their faces as assisted in their spiritual endeavors have heard their gracious teaching and were their fellow worker according to the precepts of the gospel we have written this work at the request of our father not inflated with false eloquence but concisely leaving out much and gathering facts from all the best informed people who are known not only to us but also to those who read this book for we could not record in detail all the things that each of them did but satisfied ourselves with this easier task recording only their apostolic acts we have omitted a great many acts of these saints in order to relate the most important events in detail and we have related this not for the glory of the saints of god who have already been honored for their most luminous faith and lives but as an inspiring example to their spiritual sons and to all who through them will be taught from generation to generation  xxix  and thus the blessed one s life of faith  lasted for fortyfive years and the period from the creation of the armenian alphabet to his death was thirtyfive years  which is computed as follows  the winter capital of the sassanid persian kings eighteen kilometers south of baghdad [bn]  ie his life as a clergyman [eds]  according to koriun mashtots died thirtyfive years after the invention  of the armean alphabet if the figures have not been distorted   the invention of the armenian alphabet thus occurred in  [bn]   the persian overlords of armenia who reigned during the period de scribed by koriun were kennan or kermanshah (reigned ) jazdegerd i () vram () and jazdegerd ii (   ) these dates coincide fairly well with the periods mentioned by koriun [bn] and [eds]   ,11318
